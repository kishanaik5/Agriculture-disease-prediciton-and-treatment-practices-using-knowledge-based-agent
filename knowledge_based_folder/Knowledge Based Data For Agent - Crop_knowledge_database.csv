Plant Common Name ,Disease Name (Type),Treatment Methods (Human-Friendly Guide)
Tomato,Damping Off (Fungal),"This kills young seedlings in the nursery. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride (4g/kg) before sowing. Avoid over-watering the nursery bed; the soil should not be soggy. If you see rotting, drench the soil with Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). Use raised beds to help excess water drain away."
Tomato,Early Blight (Fungal),Look for brown spots with rings on older leaves. Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Chlorothalonil (2g/liter) early in the morning. Remove and burn infected lower leaves to stop the upward spread. Rotate crops—do not plant tomatoes where you just grew potatoes or brinjals.
Tomato,Late Blight (Fungal),"A fast-spreading rot during cloudy, wet weather. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Cymoxanil (2g/liter) immediately at the first sign. Keep the field clean and avoid overhead sprinklers that wet the leaves. If it rains heavily, re-spray after the rain stops."
Tomato,Fusarium Wilt (Fungal),"The plant yellows and dries up from one side. The fungus lives in the soil, so chemical sprays don't work well. Drench the soil around roots with Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). The best fix is prevention: mix Trichoderma bio-fungicide with manure before planting and use resistant seeds."
Tomato,Septoria Leaf Spot (Fungal),Small round spots with grey centers on lower leaves. Remove infected leaves by hand to lower the fungal load. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Mancozeb (2.5g/liter). Ensure good spacing between plants so air can flow through; crowded plants trap humidity and make this worse.
Tomato,Anthracnose (Fungal),"This causes sunken, water-soaked spots on ripe fruit. It often happens when fruits touch the soil. Harvest fruit as soon as it ripens; do not leave it on the plant too long. Mulching (covering soil with straw/plastic) helps prevent soil spores from splashing onto the fruit. Spray Chlorothalonil (2g/liter) if severe."
Tomato,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"You will see a white, powdery coating on leaves, looking like flour. It happens in dry, warm weather. Spray wettable Sulfur (3g/liter) or Karathane (1ml/liter). A home remedy is spraying a mixture of milk and water (1:9 ratio) or baking soda solution, which changes the leaf surface pH."
Tomato,Buckeye Rot (Fungal),"Brown and grey rings appear on fruit touching the wet ground. It looks like a ""buck's eye."" Stake your plants to keep fruits off the soil. Mulching is the best prevention. Avoid flood irrigation that keeps the soil surface wet for too long. If needed, spray Copper Oxychloride."
Tomato,Bacterial Wilt (Bacterial),The plant droops and dies suddenly while still green. There is no chemical cure. Use wilt-resistant varieties (like Arka Abha). Dip seedling roots in Pseudomonas fluorescens before planting. Rotate crops with paddy (rice) or marigold to naturally clean the soil of bacteria.
Tomato,Bacterial Spot (Bacterial),"Small, dark, greasy spots appear on leaves and fruits. It spreads by splashing rain. Avoid overhead watering. Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10 liters water) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (30g in 10 liters). Do not work in the field when plants are wet, as you will carry the bacteria to healthy plants."
Tomato,Bacterial Canker (Bacterial),"Leaves turn brown at the edges (""firing"") and stems may split open. Fruit may have small ""bird-eye"" spots. Use disease-free seeds from trusted sources. Sterilize your pruning tools (knives/scissors) with bleach solution between plants. Remove and destroy infected plants immediately to save the rest."
Tomato,Tomato Leaf Curl (Viral),Leaves curl upward and plants remain small. Spread by whiteflies. There is no cure for the virus. Pull out and bury infected plants instantly. Control whiteflies using yellow sticky traps (15/acre) and spray Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter) or Neem oil to stop the spread.
Tomato,Spotted Wilt (TSWV) (Viral),Causes bronzing of young leaves and ring-spots on fruit. Spread by tiny insects called Thrips. Control Thrips using blue sticky traps and by spraying Fipronil or Spinosad. Keep the field borders free of weeds where thrips hide. Remove infected plants immediately.
Tomato,Mosaic Virus (ToMV) (Viral),Leaves show a light and dark green mosaic pattern. This is highly contagious and spreads by touch (smokers can spread it from tobacco!). Wash hands with soap before handling plants. Do not smoke near the field. Remove infected plants and do not compost them.
Tomato,Blossom End Rot (Physiological),The bottom of the fruit turns black and flat. This is not a disease but a Calcium deficiency caused by uneven watering. Water regularly so the soil stays moist (not soaked). Spray Calcium Chloride (2g/liter) on the fruits when they are small (marble size).
Tomato,Fruit Cracking (Physiological),cracks appear on the fruit skin. This happens when heavy rain follows a dry spell; the fruit drinks water too fast and bursts. maintain consistent soil moisture by watering regularly. Harvest fruits before heavy rains if they are close to ripening.
Tomato,Sunscald (Physiological),"White/yellow patches on the fruit where the sun hit it too hard. This happens when leaves fall off due to other diseases. Keep the plant healthy so leaves cover the fruit. In severe summers, you can use shade nets or cover fruit clusters with straw."
Tomato,Catfacing (Physiological),"Fruit becomes deformed and scarred. Caused by cold weather during flowering or high nitrogen fertilizer. Avoid planting too early in winter. Use balanced fertilizers; do not overuse Urea (Nitrogen) which causes rapid, weak growth."
Tomato,Root Knot Nematode* (Parasitic),"Plants look weak and stunted; roots have swollen ""knots"" or galls. Plant African Marigold flowers between tomato rows (their roots release chemicals that repel nematodes). Apply Neem Cake (250kg/acre) to the soil. Use Paecilomyces lilacinus (bio-agent) in the soil."
Tomato,Gray Mold (Botrytis)* (Fungal),"A grey, fuzzy mold grows on dying flowers or fruit stem ends. It loves high humidity. The best treatment is airflow—prune extra leaves and keep spacing wide. Remove dead flowers that stick to the fruit. Spray Chlorothalonil only if necessary."
Tomato,Southern Blight* (Fungal),"A white mold grows on the stem near the soil, looking like mustard seeds. The plant wilts quickly. Deep plow the field in summer to bury the fungus. Solarise soil (cover with plastic in summer). Drench the base of plants with Trichoderma."
Tomato,Leaf Mold* (Fungal),"Pale yellow spots on top of leaves, with olive-green mold underneath. Common in humid greenhouses. Improve ventilation immediately to lower humidity. Use drip irrigation instead of overhead sprays. Spray Copper-based fungicides if the infection spreads."
Cashew,Tea Mosquito Bug,"Spray Lambda-cyhalothrin or Monocrotophos early in the morning or late evening when the insects are active. Ensure proper spray coverage on new shoots, leaves, and nuts. If the attack continues, repeat the spray after 15–20 days. Do not spray during hot noon hours. Regular spraying at the correct time helps reduce heavy crop loss caused by this pest."
Cashew,Cashew Stem & Root Borer,"Inspect trees every month. If gum or sawdust is seen on the trunk, remove the bark near the spot and pull out the white worm inside. Kill the worm immediately. Clean the hole and fill it with Chlorpyriphos solution or Carbaryl paste. This treatment must be done carefully to save the tree from dying."
Cashew,Anthracnose (Blossom Blight),"Spray Bordeaux mixture (1%) or Copper Oxychloride when new reddish leaves start appearing. If rain occurs during flowering, spray again to protect flowers and young nuts. This treatment prevents flowers from drying and falling. Timely spraying during cloudy and rainy weather is very important to avoid heavy yield loss."
Cashew,Pink Disease,"Cut infected branches at least 30 cm below the affected area and burn them immediately. Apply Bordeaux paste on the cut ends to stop further infection. After pruning, spray Copper Oxychloride on nearby branches. This treatment should be completed before the monsoon season to prevent the disease from spreading to healthy branches."
Cashew,Die-back,Cut dried branch tips well below the dead portion until healthy green wood is seen. Apply Bordeaux paste on all cut surfaces to protect them. Proper pruning and sealing of cuts help stop the disease from moving downward. Timely cutting saves the tree and prevents further drying of branches.
Cashew,Gummosis,"Gently scrape out the gum from the affected bark area. After cleaning, apply Bordeaux paste or Copper Oxychloride on the wound. Ensure the treatment covers the entire affected portion. This helps stop further gum flow and prevents infection from spreading inside the trunk."
Cashew,Leaf Miner,"In young plants or nursery seedlings with heavy damage, spray Neem oil or Quinalphos once. Ensure spraying is done properly on fresh leaves. Usually one spray is enough. Avoid repeated chemical sprays, as this pest often reduces naturally once the plant grows stronger."
Cashew,Sooty Mould,"First spray Neem oil to control insects causing sticky deposits. Then spray starch solution (maida kanji) on leaves. The black layer will dry, crack, and fall off naturally. One or two sprays are sufficient. This treatment helps leaves regain normal color and function."
Cashew,Red Rust,Spray Bordeaux mixture or Copper Oxychloride if infection is severe. Ensure full coverage of affected leaves. One proper spray is usually enough. This treatment controls the algae and helps leaves recover. Regular monitoring helps avoid repeated infection.
Cashew,Powdery Mildew,Dust fine Sulphur powder or spray Wettable Sulphur early in the morning when white powder appears on flowers or leaves. One timely spray protects flowers from drying and falling. Early treatment during cool weather helps ensure better nut setting and yield.
Cashew,Cashew Apple & Nut Borer,"Collect and destroy all damaged apples and nuts immediately. Spray Spinosad or Profenophos once when fruits are small, about pea size. Proper timing of spray kills young worms before they enter fruits. This treatment helps reduce fruit damage and yield loss."
Cashew,Thrips,"If thrips attack is heavy during flowering, spray Thiamethoxam or Fipronil once. Spray should be light and well-directed on tender parts. Avoid unnecessary repeat sprays. Correct timing helps protect flowers and improves nut formation."
Cashew,Pestalotia Leaf Spot,Spray Mancozeb (2 g per litre of water) or Copper Oxychloride on affected plants. One or two sprays at 10–15 day intervals are enough. This treatment is mainly needed for young plants and nursery seedlings to prevent leaf damage.
Cashew,Shoot Rot & Leaf Fall,Spray Bordeaux mixture (1%) just before the start of heavy monsoon rains. One preventive spray protects tender shoots from rotting and reduces leaf fall. Proper timing of this spray is very important to protect the crop during continuous rainy periods.
Cotton,Pink Bollworm,"Put pheromone traps (5 per acre) to catch adult moths early. Check flowers often and remove rosette flowers and destroy them. If worms increase, spray Profenophos or Emamectin Benzoate as advised. Do not delay spraying once worms enter bolls. After harvest, allow sheep grazing or deep ploughing to kill worms left in the soil."
Cotton,American Bollworm,"Grow marigold or cowpea around the field to attract worms away from cotton. Fix bird perches so birds eat caterpillars. If worms increase, spray Spinosad or Indoxacarb. Do not use the same pesticide repeatedly. Timely spraying saves flowers and bolls from damage."
Cotton,Bacterial Blight (Black Arm),"Treat seeds with Streptocycline before sowing. If disease appears, spray Copper Oxychloride (3 g per litre) mixed with Streptocycline (1 g per 10 litres). Spray again after rain if needed. Avoid sprinkler irrigation. After harvest, collect and destroy old cotton plants to stop disease spread."
Cotton,Cotton Leaf Curl Virus,"There is no medicine to cure this virus. Control whitefly, which spreads it. Use yellow sticky traps and spray Neem oil or Diafenthiuron when whiteflies increase. Always grow virus-resistant cotton varieties. Remove infected plants early to protect healthy ones nearby."
Cotton,"Sucking Pests (Jassids, Aphids, Thrips)","Treat seeds with Imidacloprid for early protection. If pests appear later, spray Acetamiprid or Flonicamid. Use yellow sticky traps to reduce insects. Avoid unnecessary spraying when helpful insects are present. Correct spraying at the right time prevents leaf curling and yield loss."
Cotton,Whitefly,"Spray Neem oil, Spiromesifen, or Pyriproxyfen when whiteflies increase. Always spray on the lower side of leaves, where they hide. Do not use too much urea fertilizer. Keep field borders free from weeds. Proper control prevents virus spread and black leaf coating."
Cotton,Mealybug,"First destroy ant nests, as ants protect mealybugs. Spray Profenophos or Buprofezin directly on white cotton-like insects. For small attack, wash insects with strong water spray. If attack is heavy, remove and burn infected plants immediately to stop spreading."
Cotton,Alternaria Leaf Spot,Spray Mancozeb (2.5 g per litre) or Propiconazole (1 ml per litre) when brown spots appear. Repeat after 10–15 days if needed. Apply enough potash fertilizer. Remove fallen infected leaves from the field to reduce disease spread.
Cotton,Grey Mildew (Dahiya),"When white powder appears on leaves, spray Wettable Sulphur (3 g per litre) or Carbendazim. One or two sprays are usually enough. Early spraying prevents leaf fall and helps proper boll formation at later crop stages."
Cotton,Root Rot,"Treat seeds with Trichoderma before sowing. If affected patches appear, drench soil around them with Copper Oxychloride. Improve drainage and avoid water stagnation. Early prevention is very important, as infected plants cannot be saved later."
Cotton,Fusarium Wilt,Use wilt-resistant cotton varieties. Mix Trichoderma with compost and apply to soil during planting. Follow crop rotation with maize or jowar. These methods reduce fungus in soil and protect future crops.
Cotton,Parawilt (Sudden Wilt),"Remove excess water immediately after heavy rain or irrigation. Spray 2% urea or DAP solution on leaves to help plants recover. If available, drench roots with Cobalt Chloride. Proper water management prevents further plant damage."
Cotton,Stem Weevil,"Do earthing up around the base of plants to stop egg laying. Drench the stem base with Chlorpyriphos. After harvest, remove and burn cotton stalks to kill hidden insects. This reduces next season’s attack."
Cotton,Tobacco Caterpillar (Spodoptera),"Crush egg masses seen on leaves. Install pheromone traps. If caterpillars increase, spray Novaluron or Thiodicarb. Use poison bait (rice bran + jaggery + pesticide) in the evening. Early control prevents heavy leaf damage."
Cucumber,Downy Mildew,"This is the most dangerous disease. You will see yellow, angular spots on the top of leaves and a violet/grey fuzz underneath. It spreads fast in wet weather. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2.5g/liter) or Cymoxanil immediately. Don't water from overhead; keep leaves dry. If not treated, the plant will burn up quickly."
Cucumber,Powdery Mildew,"Look for white, flour-like powder on leaves and stems. It usually happens in dry, warm weather. Spray wettable Sulphur (2g/liter) or Karathane. A home remedy is to spray a mix of baking soda and water, or diluted milk (1 part milk, 9 parts water). Remove leaves that are heavily coated."
Cucumber,Cucumber Mosaic Virus,"Leaves become mottled (mix of light and dark green), wrinkled, and misshapen. Fruits become bumpy and bitter. There is no medicine for this virus. Remove and bury infected plants immediately. Control the Aphids that spread it by using yellow sticky traps and spraying Neem oil or Imidacloprid."
Cucumber,Fruit Fly,"This fly lays eggs inside the fruit. The maggots eat the inside, causing the fruit to rot and drop. This is a major headache for farmers. Use ""Pheromone Traps"" (fruit fly lures) to catch male flies (4-6 traps per acre). Collect and bury all fallen fruits deep in the soil so maggots don't survive. You can also spray Neem oil to repel them."
Cucumber,Anthracnose,"You will see reddish-brown spots on leaves and sunken, slimy salmon-pink spots on the fruit. This happens often in warm, rainy weather. Treat seeds with Carbendazim before planting. If you see spots, spray Chlorothalonil or Mancozeb (2.5g/liter). Rotate crops—don't plant cucumber in the same spot every season."
Cucumber,Angular Leaf Spot,"Small, water-soaked spots appear on leaves that look square or angular (because veins stop them). The dead tissue falls out, leaving ""shot holes."" Avoid overhead sprinklers. Spray Copper Oxychloride (2.5g/liter) or Streptocycline to stop this bacteria. Don't work in the field when plants are wet."
Cucumber,Fusarium Wilt,"The plant turns yellow and wilts slowly, usually starting from older leaves. If you cut the stem near the soil, you see brown streaks inside. Use resistant seeds. Drench the soil with Trichoderma viride (bio-fungicide) or Carbendazim. This fungus stays in soil for years, so rotate with crops like corn or spinach."
Cucumber,Gummy Stem Blight,"The stem turns brown and may split, oozing a gummy, amber-colored sticky fluid. Leaves may develop large brown spots. Spray Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil. Improve air circulation by pruning extra vines. Avoid wetting the stems while watering. Clean up all plant debris after harvest."
Cucumber,Root Knot Nematode,"Plants look weak, stunted, and yellow, even if you water them well. If you pull up the roots, they have swollen knots or galls. Add plenty of Neem cake to the soil before planting. Plant Marigold flowers between rows to repel them. Solarize the soil (cover with plastic in summer) to kill them with heat."
Cucumber,Red Pumpkin Beetle,"Bright orange/red beetles eat holes in young leaves and flowers. The grubs (babies) eat the roots underground. Pick and kill beetles by hand in the early morning when they are sluggish. Dust wood ash on the leaves to repel them. If the attack is heavy, spray Chlorpyriphos or Malathion carefully."
Cucumber,Thrips,"Tiny insects that scrape the leaves, making them look silvery or bronze. They can also damage the fruit skin. Use blue sticky traps to catch them. Spray Fipronil or Spinosad if the population is high. Keep the field free of weeds where they like to hide."
Cucumber,Aphids,"Small green or black bugs cluster on the underside of leaves and suck sap. They leave a sticky residue (honeydew) that turns black (sooty mold). Spray simple soapy water or Neem oil first. If that doesn't work, use Imidacloprid. Ladybugs are friends—they eat aphids, so don't kill them!"
Cucumber,Leaf Miner,"You will see white, snake-like winding trails on the leaves. The maggot is inside the leaf eating its way through. Usually, you don't need heavy chemicals. Remove leaves with many trails. Spray Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE 5%) to stop the adult fly from laying eggs."
Grape,Downy Mildew,"This is the biggest threat in rainy/cloudy weather. Look for yellow ""oil spots"" on top of leaves and white fungal growth underneath. Spray Bordeaux mixture (1%) or Copper Oxychloride immediately. If the attack is severe, use systemic fungicides like Metalaxyl or Cymoxanil. Prune extra shoots to keep the canopy open so air flows through."
Grape,Powdery Mildew,"White, ash-like powder covers the leaves and berries. This happens in cool, dry weather. The berries may crack and rot. Dust Sulphur powder (20kg/acre) or spray Wettable Sulphur. If the infection is high, use fungicides like Hexaconazole or Myclobutanil. Keep the center of the vine open to sunlight."
Grape,Anthracnose (Bird's Eye Spot),You will see small brown spots with grey centers and red borders on leaves and berries (looks like a bird’s eye). It spreads fast in rain. Prune and burn infected twigs. Spray Copper Oxychloride or Thiophanate Methyl. Do this early when new shoots appear after pruning to protect the young growth.
Grape,Mealybug,"White, cotton-like masses appear on stems and bunches. They suck sap and make the fruit sticky and black (sooty mold). Ants protect them, so kill ant nests first. Wash the vines with a strong water jet. Spray Buprofezin or Methomyl. Applying a sticky grease band around the main trunk stops them from climbing up."
Grape,Thrips,"These tiny insects scratch the berry skin, causing ""corky"" or scabby brown patches (scab). This destroys the market value of the fruit. Use blue sticky traps to monitor them. Spray Fipronil or Spinosad during the berry setting stage. Keep the vineyard weed-free."
Grape,Flea Beetle,"This beetle eats the swelling buds just after pruning. If they eat the bud, you lose the whole bunch for that season. It is very dangerous. Identify them by the ""shot holes"" they make in leaves. Spray Phosalone or Quinalphos immediately after pruning if you see beetles. Loose bark on the trunk should be removed as they hide there."
Grape,Bacterial Leaf Spot,"Small water-soaked spots appear on leaves and stems, eventually drying up and cracking. It often strikes after heavy rain or hail. Spray Streptocycline (0.5g/liter) mixed with Copper Oxychloride. Avoid overhead sprinkling. Do not perform pruning or handling when the vines are wet."
Grape,Stem Borer,The vine looks weak and leaves turn yellow. Look for holes in the main trunk with wood dust (sawdust) coming out. Clean the hole with a wire. Insert a cotton wick soaked in Dichlorvos or petrol into the hole and seal it with mud/clay. This kills the worm inside.
Grape,Mites,"Leaves turn reddish-brown or bronze and look dusty. This happens in hot, dry weather. They spin fine webs on the underside of leaves. Spray Dicofol or Wettable Sulphur. Avoid using synthetic pyrethroids (like Cypermethrin) as they can actually make mite problems worse."
Grape,Berry Cracking,"Fruits split open, usually after sudden rain near harvest. This is often due to irregular watering or Calcium deficiency. Maintain consistent soil moisture (don't let it get too dry then flood it). Spray Calcium Chloride and Boron during berry development to strengthen the skin."
Grape,Dead Arm (Phomopsis),"Dark, canoe-shaped spots appear on the bottom of shoots. The cane may break easily. It weakens the vine over years. Prune out dead wood during the dormant season. Spray Mancozeb or Copper fungicides just as the buds are breaking (opening) to protect new growth."
Corn,Fall Armyworm (FAW),"This is the biggest new threat. The caterpillar hides inside the central funnel (whorl) and eats leaves, leaving lots of ""sawdust"" poop. It has a ""Y"" mark on its head. In early stages, spray Emamectin Benzoate or Spinetoram. You can also put wet sand or soil mixed with ash into the funnel to suffocate the worm."
Corn,Maize Stem Borer,"The worm bores into the stem. You will see ""pinholes"" in lines on the leaves. If it attacks young plants, the central leaf dries up (Dead Heart). Apply Carbofuran granules (3-4 granules per plant) directly inside the leaf whorl/funnel. If spraying, use Chlorantraniliprole. Remove dead stalks from the field after harvest so they don't hide there."
Corn,Turcicum Leaf Blight,"Long, boat-shaped grey/brown spots appear on leaves. It looks like the leaf was burnt. It usually comes when the weather is cool and humid. Spray Mancozeb (2.5g/liter) or Zineb as soon as you see the spots. If the disease is severe, use Propiconazole. Plant resistant hybrids if this is common in your area."
Corn,Common Rust,"You will see small, powdery brown bumps (pustules) on both sides of the leaves. It looks like rust on iron. This happens in cool, wet weather. Usually, Indian maize is tough enough to handle this, but if the infection is very high, spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Wettable Sulphur to stop it from spreading."
Corn,Downy Mildew,"Leaves develop yellow/white stripes and look velvety underneath. In severe cases, the tassel (flower) becomes leafy and deformed (""Crazy Top""). This starts from the soil or seeds. Treat seeds with Metalaxyl before sowing (6g/kg). Remove and bury infected plants immediately. Do not plant maize in the same field year after year."
Corn,Charcoal Rot,"The plant stalks become weak and rot near the ground, often falling over. If you split the stalk, the inside looks black and dusty like charcoal. This happens when the weather is very hot and dry after flowering. The best prevention is regular irrigation—don't let the soil crack from dryness. Use Trichoderma in the soil."
Corn,Shoot Fly,This attacks very young seedlings (up to 2 weeks old). The central leaf wilts and dries up. It is worse if you plant late. Treat seeds with Imidacloprid (10ml/kg) before sowing. Use a higher seed rate (plant extra seeds) so you can pull out the damaged ones and still have a full field.
Corn,Termites,"They eat the roots and base of the stem, and the plant falls over. This is common in dry, sandy red soils. Mix Chlorpyriphos or Fipronil dust in the soil before planting. If the standing crop is attacked, drench the soil with Chlorpyriphos (4ml/liter of water) near the plant base. Avoid using raw (undecomposed) farmyard manure."
Corn,Banded Leaf & Sheath Blight,"You will see large, dirty-colored spots with bands on the leaves and the sheath (the part of the leaf hugging the stem). It spreads from the ground up. Remove the lower leaves that touch the ground. Spray Propiconazole or Hexaconazole if the disease moves up towards the corn cob."
Corn,Maydis Leaf Blight,"Small, diamond-shaped or rectangular yellow-brown spots appear on leaves. The spots may merge and kill the whole leaf. It is common in warm, wet areas. Spray Mancozeb (2.5g/liter) or Dithane M-45. Crop rotation helps because the fungus survives on old corn trash in the field."
Orange,Citrus Canker,"You will see rough, brown, raised corky spots on leaves and fruit. It spreads fast in wet weather. Prune and burn infected twigs first. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) mixed with Streptocycline (1g in 10 liters). Since this is bacterial, adding the antibiotic (Streptocycline) is very important. To prevent it, plant windbreaks (tall trees) around the orchard to stop wind-blown bacteria."
Orange,Gummosis (Foot Rot),"Dark gum oozes from the trunk near the ground, and the bark rots. This happens if the soil is too wet. Scrape the infected bark with a sharp knife until you reach healthy wood. Apply Bordeaux Paste on the wound. Drench the soil around the roots with Metalaxyl or Copper Oxychloride. Ensure water does not touch the main trunk during irrigation (use the double-ring method)."
Orange,Citrus Greening,"Leaves show yellow mottling (patches of yellow and green), and fruits stay small, green, and bitter. This is spread by a tiny insect called Psylla. There is no cure for the disease itself. You must cut down infected trees to save the rest. Control the Psylla insect by spraying Imidacloprid or Dimethoate regularly."
Orange,Die-Back,Branches start drying from the tip downwards (like a burning candle). Leaves fall off and the tree looks thin. This is often due to poor nutrition or root problems. Prune the dead branches 2–3 inches into the healthy green wood. Apply Copper Oxychloride paste on cut ends. Feed the tree well with fertilizers and micronutrients (Zinc/Boron) to boost its strength.
Orange,Leaf Miner,"You will see shiny, silvery zig-zag trails on young leaves. The leaves curl and look ugly. This attacks the tender new growth (flush). Spray Neem oil (10ml/liter) or Imidacloprid as soon as new leaves appear. Since the worm is inside the leaf, simple contact poisons don't work well; systemic medicines are better."
Orange,Fruit Sucking Moth,This moth pierces ripe fruit at night to drink juice. The fruit rots and falls after a few days. Insecticides don't work well because the moth flies away. The best solution is to destroy fallen rotting fruits daily so they don't attract more moths. You can also hang poison baits (jaggery water + pesticide) in the orchard.
Orange,Citrus Psylla,"A small louse that sits on new buds. It spreads the deadly Greening disease. If you see them, spray Monocrotophos or Thiamethoxam immediately. Pruning the orchard to keep it open and airy helps reduce their population. Protecting new flush (new leaves) is the most critical time to spray."
Orange,Aphids,"Black or green bugs cluster on the underside of tender leaves and suck sap. They leave sticky honeydew which turns into black soot (Sooty Mold). They also spread the Tristeza Virus. Spray Dimethoate or soapy water. Ladybugs eat them, so try to use milder sprays like Neem oil first to save the friendly insects."
Orange,Powdery Mildew,"White powder appears on young leaves and small fruits. The leaves may twist and fall. This happens in cool, dry mornings. Spray Wettable Sulphur (3g/liter) or Karathane. Removing water shoots (fast-growing weak branches) helps air circulation and reduces this disease."
Orange,Lemon Butterfly,"For small gardens, simply hand-pick the caterpillars. Note: The young ones look exactly like bird droppings, while older ones are bright green. If the infestation is high, spray Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) at 2g/liter or Neem oil (5ml/liter) for a natural cure. For severe attacks in large orchards, spray Quinalphos or Chlorpyriphos. Check new leaves often during monsoon, as they can eat all the leaves in just a few days."
Paddy,Rice Blast (Fungal),"This causes ""burnt"" spots on leaves or broken ""necks."" To treat, spray Tricyclazole (0.6g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). Avoid using too much Urea, which makes plants weak. Treat seeds with Pseudomonas fluorescens (10g/kg) before sowing. If ""Neck Blast"" appears during the grain stage, spray immediately to save your yield and prevent empty grains."
Paddy,Brown Spot (Fungal),"Small, oval brown spots appear on leaves, often in weak soil. Fix this by improving soil health with balanced fertilizers (NPK) and Zinc. If the infection is heavy, spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Edifenphos (1ml/liter). Soaking seeds in hot water (52°C) for 10 minutes before planting can kill hidden spores. It is often a ""disease of the poor soil,"" so good manuring helps prevent it."
Paddy,Bacterial Leaf Blight (Bacterial),"This causes long, wavy yellow-white streaks from leaf tips. It spreads fast in wind and rain. There is no easy cure, but spraying Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (20g) helps slow it down. Reduce Nitrogen levels and drain the field for a few days to stop bacteria from moving through the water to healthy plants."
Paddy,Sheath Blight (Fungal),"Look for greenish-grey ""snake-skin"" patches on leaf sheaths near the water line. It loves crowded, wet fields. To treat, spray Hexaconazole (2ml/liter) or Validamycin (2ml/liter) directly at the base of plants where the stem meets the water. Keep the field free of weeds and avoid planting too closely; wider spacing allows air to dry out the dampness."
Paddy,False Smut (Fungal),"Grains turn into large, velvety orange-to-black ""smut balls"" during flowering in cool, rainy weather. Once balls appear, they cannot be cured. Prevention is key: spray Copper Oxychloride (2.5g/liter) or Propiconazole (1ml/liter) during the ""booting"" stage (just before grain-heads emerge). Remove and burn any smut balls seen to prevent the fungus from staying in the soil."
Paddy,Sheath Rot (Fungal),"This rots the leaf sheath covering the young grain-head, stopping it from coming out fully. It usually happens when insects wound the plant. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter) or Mancozeb (2g/liter) at the ""booting"" stage. Controlling stem borers and other insects is vital, as their bites create the entry points for this fungus to infect the plant from inside."
Paddy,Rice Tungro (Viral),"Plants turn orange-yellow and stop growing (stunted). This virus is spread by Green Leafhoppers. You cannot treat the virus itself, so you must kill the insects. Spray Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter) or Thiamethoxam immediately. Pull out and bury infected yellow plants instantly. Using resistant varieties like Vikramarya is the most effective way to avoid this disease entirely."
Paddy,Bakanae / Foot Rot (Fungal),"Some plants grow much taller and thinner than others, eventually turning pale and dying. This is a seed-borne disease. The best treatment is seed soaking: treat seeds with Carbendazim (2g/kg) before sowing. If you see these ""foolish"" tall seedlings in the field, pull them out carefully and destroy them so they don’t spread the fungus into the soil for next year."
Paddy,Stem Rot (Fungal),"Small black spots appear on the leaf sheath at the water level; later, the stem rots and the plant falls over. Draining the water and letting the soil crack for a few days can stop the fungus from spreading. Apply extra Potassium (Potash) to strengthen the stem walls. If severe, drench the base of plants with Thiophanate-methyl (1g/liter) to protect the stem."
Paddy,Grain Discoloration (Complex),"Grains turn black, red, or dark brown, making them look dirty and reducing market price. This is caused by various germs attacking during the ""milky"" stage. To prevent this, spray a combination of Mancozeb and Carbendazim (2g/liter) when grains are just forming. Ensure the field is free of weeds, as they act as a home for these germs between seasons."
Paddy,Khaira Disease (Zinc Deficiency),"This is a nutritional problem, not a germ. Spray Zinc Sulphate (5g) mixed with Lime (2.5g) in 1 liter of water as soon as you see dusty brown spots. For a 1-acre field, use 2kg Zinc Sulphate with 1kg Lime in 400 liters of water. For future crops, apply Zinc Sulphate (25kg per hectare) directly into the soil during land preparation."
Paddy,Bacterial Leaf Streak (Bacterial),"This appears as fine, transparent streaks between leaf veins. Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (20g). Avoid excess Nitrogen, which makes leaves soft and easy to infect. Keep water levels low and avoid moving through the field while plants are wet to prevent spreading the bacteria on your clothes or tools to healthy areas."
Paddy,Narrow Brown Leaf Spot (Fungal),"You will see thin, short brown lines on the leaves. It usually happens in soils lacking Potassium. To treat, spray Propiconazole (1ml/liter) or Mancozeb (2g/liter) at the booting stage. The best long-term solution is to ensure you apply enough Muriate of Potash (MOP) during the early stages of the crop to make the plants naturally resistant."
Paddy,Ufra Disease (Nematode),"Caused by tiny worms in the soil. Apply Carbofuran 3G granules (10-12 kg per acre) into the standing water. After harvesting, burn the left-over stubble or plow the field deeply during summer to kill the worms hiding in the soil. Rotating your crop with non-cereal plants like pulses for one season will starve the worms and clean the field naturally."
Paddy,Udbatta Disease (Fungal),"The grain-head comes out looking like a thin, silvery-white ""candle"" instead of grains. This lives inside the seed, so treat seeds with hot water (52°C) or Carbendazim (2g/kg) before planting. If you see ""candle"" heads in the field, pull them out carefully and bury them immediately so the black powder doesn't blow onto healthy plants or infect the soil."
Paddy,Leaf Scald (Fungal),"Leaf tips look bleached or ""scalded"" with brown wavy bands. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter) at the first sign. Avoid heavy Nitrogen doses, especially in the rainy season. Ensure enough space between plants for air to flow; crowded plants stay wet longer, which helps this fungus spread. Proper drainage and balanced nutrition are the best ways to keep the leaves healthy."
Paddy,Kernel Smut / Bunt (Fungal),"A few grains turn into a black, powdery mass. It is hard to ""cure"" once visible. Prevent it by treating seeds with Carboxin or Carbendazim (2g/kg) before sowing. Spraying Propiconazole (1ml/liter) when the ""boot"" leaf is visible protects emerging grains. Avoid heavy irrigation and high Nitrogen during flowering, as moisture and soft growth encourage this disease to take hold."
Rice,Rice Blast (Fungal),"Look for spindle or ""eye-shaped"" spots with grey centers on the leaves. To treat, spray Tricyclazole (0.6g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). Avoid giving all your Urea fertilizer at once; splitting the dose keeps the leaves from becoming too soft and ""juicy"" for the fungus. Always treat seeds with Pseudomonas fluorescens before sowing to build early leaf strength."
Rice,Bacterial Leaf Blight (Bacterial),"This shows as yellow-to-white wavy streaks starting from the leaf tips. Since chemicals can't ""cure"" bacteria easily, spray a mix of Streptocycline (1g in 10L) and Copper Oxychloride (20g) to stop the spread. Reduce Nitrogen fertilizer immediately and drain the field water for 3 days. This stops the bacteria from swimming from one plant to the next through the water."
Rice,Brown Spot (Fungal),"You will see small, dark brown oval spots that look like sesame seeds on the leaves. This usually happens in ""hungry"" or weak soil. To treat, spray Mancozeb (2g/liter). Long-term, you must improve soil health by adding Zinc and Potash. It is often called the ""poor farmer’s disease"" because it only attacks plants that aren't getting enough nutrition from the ground."
Rice,Sheath Blight (Fungal),"Large, greenish-grey ""snake-skin"" patches appear on the leaf sheaths and spread up to the leaf blades. Spray Hexaconazole (2ml/liter) or Validamycin (2ml/liter) directly at the base and on the affected leaves. Avoid planting too closely; wider spacing allows the wind to dry the leaves. Keep the field bunds clean of grass and weeds where the fungus hides."
Rice,Khaira Disease (Zinc Deficiency),"This is a nutrition problem where the young leaves turn yellow at the base and develop rusty brown spots. To fix it, spray a mixture of Zinc Sulphate (5g) and Lime (2.5g) per 1 liter of water. You will see the leaves turn green again in 7–10 days. For the next crop, make sure to apply 25kg of Zinc Sulphate per hectare directly into the soil."
Rice,Bacterial Leaf Streak (Bacterial),"Look for very thin, straight, transparent lines between the leaf veins that eventually turn brown. Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (30g). Just like Leaf Blight, this disease loves high Nitrogen. Ensure your field has good drainage and avoid walking through the crop when the leaves are wet, as the bacteria can stick to your clothes."
Rice,Narrow Brown Leaf Spot (Fungal),"This shows as very short, narrow brown lines that look like pencil marks on the leaves. To treat it, spray Propiconazole (1ml/liter). This disease is a signal that your plant needs more Potassium. Applying Muriate of Potash (MOP) during the early growth stages thickens the leaf walls, making it much harder for the fungus to poke through and start an infection."
Rice,Leaf Scald (Fungal),"The tips of the leaves look bleached or ""burnt"" with wavy, water-soaked brown bands. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter) at the first sign of these marks. Avoid heavy Nitrogen doses during the rainy season. This fungus spreads when wet leaves rub against each other, so proper spacing and removing weeds that keep the field too humid are the best ways to prevent it."
Rice,Rice Tungro Virus (Viral),"The leaves turn a distinct orange-yellow color from the tip downwards, and the plant stops growing. You cannot treat the virus itself, so you must kill the Green Leafhoppers that carry it. Spray Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter) immediately. If you see only a few yellow plants, pull them out and bury them deep in the mud so the insects don't spread the virus further."
Rice,Red Stripe* (Bacterial),"You will see bright red or orange-brown stripes running along the length of the leaf. This usually happens after heavy rains or high winds. To treat, spray Copper Oxychloride (2.5g/liter). Since this is a bacterial infection, avoid using too much Urea, which makes the stripes grow faster. Ensure the field is not overcrowded so the leaves can dry out quickly after it rains."
Rice,Leaf Smut* (Fungal),"Small, slightly raised black spots appear on both sides of the leaf, looking like tiny specks of charcoal. It usually doesn't kill the plant but reduces the leaf's ability to make food. Spraying Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) can control it. It is most common in shaded areas of the field, so ensure your crop gets plenty of direct sunlight."
Pepper Bell,Cercospora Leaf Spot (Fungal),"You will see small, circular spots with light grey centers and dark red-brown borders. To treat, spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). If the leaves start falling off, ensure you remove and burn them. Avoid overhead watering, as splashing water spreads the fungal spores to healthy leaves."
Pepper Bell,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"This appears as a white, flour-like powder on the underside of leaves, while the top shows yellow patches. In dry, warm weather, it spreads fast. Spray wettable Sulfur (3g/liter) or Dinocap (1ml/liter). A home remedy is a mixture of baking soda and water (5g/liter). Ensure good spacing for better airflow between plants."
Pepper Bell,Bacterial Leaf Spot (Bacterial),"Look for small, water-soaked dark spots that eventually turn brown and ""warty."" Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). Use disease-free seeds and avoid working in the field when plants are wet. Rotate crops so you aren't planting peppers or tomatoes in the same spot every year."
Pepper Bell,Chilli Leaf Curl Virus (Viral),"The leaves curl upwards, become small, and look ""crinkled"" or leathery. This is spread by tiny whiteflies. You cannot ""cure"" the virus, so focus on the insects. Spray Neem oil (5ml/liter) or Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter). Install yellow sticky traps (15 per acre) to catch whiteflies. Pull out and bury infected plants immediately."
Pepper Bell,Phytophthora Blight (Fungal),"This causes large, dark-brown water-soaked patches on the leaves and leads to sudden wilting. It usually strikes during heavy rains. To treat, spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter). Improve your field's drainage immediately so water doesn't stand. Use raised beds for planting to keep the ""collar"" of the plant dry and safe from soil fungus."
Pepper Bell,Mosaic Virus (Viral),"The leaves show a ""mosaic"" pattern of light and dark green patches. This is spread by aphids or through touch. Control aphids using sticky traps and Neem spray. Always wash your hands and tools with soap after touching a sick plant. There is no chemical cure; infected plants must be removed and destroyed to save the rest."
Pepper Bell,Anthracnose / Dieback (Fungal),It starts as small black spots on leaves and causes the branch tips to dry up like they are dying back. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Azoxystrobin (1ml/liter). Use healthy seeds and treat them with Trichoderma before sowing. Keep the field clean and ensure you aren't over-fertilizing with Nitrogen.
Pepper Bell,Septoria Leaf Spot* (Fungal),"Small, circular spots with white centers and tiny black dots (spores) inside them. This can cause the plant to lose all its leaves. Spraying Chlorothalonil (2g/liter) or Mancozeb (2.5g/liter) works very well. Remove the infected lower leaves by hand and improve air circulation by pruning extra branches near the bottom of the plant."
Pepper Bell,Grey Mold* (Fungal),"A fuzzy grey mold grows on leaves, stems, or flowers during cool, damp weather. It enters through wounds. The best treatment is airflow—prune your plants and keep them spaced out. If it spreads, spray Carbendazim (1g/liter). Avoid high humidity by using drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinklers."
Pepper Bell,Tomato Spotted Wilt Virus* (Viral),"Young leaves turn bronze and develop small, dark spots or rings. Spread by tiny insects called Thrips. Control Thrips using blue sticky traps and by spraying Fipronil or Spinosad. Keep the field borders free of weeds where thrips hide. Once a plant is infected, it cannot be cured and should be removed."
Pepper Bell,Southern Blight* (Fungal),"Leaves wilt quickly as a white, ""cottony"" mold grows on the stem at the soil line. It looks like small mustard seeds are stuck to the stem. Deep plow the field in summer to bury the fungus. Solarise the soil with plastic sheets. Drench the base of the plants with a Trichoderma solution to protect the roots and stem."
Pepper Bell,Fusarium Wilt (Fungal),"The lower leaves turn yellow and the plant wilts, often on just one side first. Since this is in the soil, sprays don't help much. Drench the soil with Carbendazim (2g/liter). Mixing Trichoderma into your compost before planting is the best organic prevention. Ensure your soil isn't constantly soggy, as the fungus loves wet roots."
Strawberry,Gray Mold (Fungal),"Also called Botrytis. You will see grey, fuzzy mold on berries, usually after rain. Improve airflow by spacing plants well and weeding. Pick and bury rotting fruit immediately so spores don't spread. Avoid overhead watering. If rain is heavy during flowering, spray Cyprodinil + Fludioxonil (Switch), but keeping plants dry and mulched is the most effective cure."
Strawberry,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"Leaves curl upward like a cup and show white powdery dust underneath. This happens in humid conditions. Spray wettable Sulfur (2g/liter) or a baking soda solution (5g/liter) to change the leaf surface pH. If growing in a polyhouse, open vents to lower humidity. Ensure sunlight reaches the inner leaves to keep the plant dry."
Strawberry,Anthracnose (Fungal),"Black, sunken spots appear on fruit; it can also kill runners. It spreads via infected nursery plants or splashing rain. Use disease-free seedlings. Use drip irrigation to stop water splashing soil spores onto fruit. Mulch with straw/plastic to create a barrier between fruit and soil. Spray Copper Oxychloride or Mancozeb if spots appear on runners."
Strawberry,Common Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small purple spots with white/grey centers on leaves. It attacks older leaves first. Remove and burn these infected leaves to lower the disease load. Spray Copper-based fungicides (2g/liter) or Mancozeb. Do not work in the field when plants are wet, as your clothes can carry the fungus from sick to healthy plants."
Strawberry,Leaf Scorch (Fungal),"Irregular purple or brown spots without white centers. Eventually, the leaves look ""scorched"" or burnt and dry up. It spreads by splashing water. The treatment is similar to Leaf Spot: remove old debris and apply fungicides like Captan or Thiram. keeping the plant vigorous with good nutrition helps it resist this infection better than weak plants."
Strawberry,Leaf Blight (Fungal),"Large, V-shaped brown spots start from the leaf edge and move inward. It often happens after harvest. Sanitate the field by removing old leaves. If the infection is severe, spray with Carbendazim or Thiophanate-methyl. Since this fungus survives on dead leaves in winter, cleaning your field at the end of the season is the best prevention."
Strawberry,Red Stele (Fungal),"The plant looks stunted and wilts even with water. If you cut the root, the core is rusty red (not white). It thrives in waterlogged soil. There is no cure; remove infected plants. Prevention is key: plant on raised beds (15cm high) for drainage. Dip new roots in Metalaxyl solution before planting."
Strawberry,Phytophthora Crown Rot (Fungal),"The entire plant collapses suddenly. Cutting the crown (the thick stem base) reveals reddish-brown rot inside. Avoid over-watering and heavy soils. Use Fosetyl-Aluminium (Aliette) as a drench if permitted in your area. Use certified disease-free transplants, as this often comes from the nursery. Do not plant strawberries in low spots where water collects."
Strawberry,Leather Rot (Fungal),"Fruit becomes hard, brown, leathery, and tastes bitter. This happens when fruit touches wet soil or mud splashes on it. The best fix is a physical barrier: use a thick layer of straw mulch or plastic so berries never touch dirt. Harvest ripe fruit quickly. If heavy rains are forecast, protect with a Captan spray beforehand."
Strawberry,Verticillium Wilt (Fungal),"Older outer leaves turn brown and dry while inner leaves stay green. The fungus stays in soil for years. Do not plant strawberries where you recently grew tomatoes, potatoes, or brinjal. If soil is infected, use Soil Solarisation (covering wet soil with clear plastic in hot summer) to cook the fungus. There is no chemical cure for infected plants."
Strawberry,Fusarium Wilt (Fungal),"Plants wilt rapidly, and roots turn dark brown/black. It loves warm weather (above 25°C). Since this is a soil-borne fungus, chemical sprays on leaves won't help. Drench soil with Trichoderma viride bio-fungicide regularly to protect roots. Solarise the soil before planting. If a plant dies, remove it with a shovel of soil surrounding it to remove the fungus."
Strawberry,Black Root Rot (Complex),"This is not one disease but a mix of fungi, nematodes, and poor soil health. Roots turn black and rot. It happens in compacted, old soil. Improve soil aeration by adding organic matter (compost). Rotate crops every 2-3 years. Do not replant strawberries in the same spot immediately. Use bio-agents like Trichoderma and Pseudomonas to boost root health."
Strawberry,Angular Leaf Spot (Bacterial),"Small, water-soaked spots on the underside of leaves that look translucent when held up to light. Later they turn brown. Since this is bacterial, fungicides don't work well. Avoid overhead sprinklers completely. Spray Copper Hydroxide to limit spread. Do not harvest or prune when plants are wet."
Strawberry,Bacterial Wilt (Bacterial),"Plants wilt during the day and recover at night, eventually dying. A milky ooze comes out if you cut the stem and put it in water. There is no cure. Remove and burn infected plants. Control weeds strictly. Rotate with mustard or marigold crops to suppress soil bacteria naturally. Ensure your tools are sterilized with bleach between rows."
Strawberry,Strawberry Mottle Virus (Viral),"Plants look stunted, and leaves may have uneven yellow patches, but symptoms are often unclear. It is spread by aphids. You cannot cure a virus. Control aphids using sticky traps and Neem oil sprays. Always buy ""certified virus-free"" plants from a lab or nursery. Remove any plant that looks dwarf or sickly immediately."
Strawberry,Strawberry Crinkle Virus (Viral),"Leaves look crinkled, distorted, or have yellow spots. Also spread by aphids. The management is the same as other viruses: strict insect control. Keep the field border clean of weeds where aphids hide. If you see one infected plant, assume nearby plants might have it too and monitor them closely."
Strawberry,Phyllody (Phytoplasma),"The flower petals turn into small green leaves, and the fruit looks woody. This is caused by phytoplasma spread by Leafhoppers. It looks strange but is serious. Pull out infected plants immediately. Control leafhoppers with appropriate insecticides (like Imidacloprid) or sticky traps. Keep the area free of weeds which host the hoppers."
Strawberry,Root Knot Nematode (Parasitic),"Plants are weak/stunted. Roots have swollen ""knots"" or galls. Plant African Marigold flowers thickly between rows or as a rotation crop; their roots release chemicals that repel nematodes. Apply Neem Cake (200kg/acre) to the soil before planting. Use bio-nematicides like Paecilomyces lilacinus mixed with manure."
Strawberry,Slime Mold (Fungal/Mold),"A white, grey, or yellow slimy coating appears on leaves or stems. It looks scary but actually doesn't hurt the plant much; it just sits on top. It usually goes away when the weather dries. You can wash it off with a strong jet of water. No chemical treatment is usually needed. Improve airflow to prevent it."
Strawberry,Sunscald (Physiological),"Berries develop pale, bleached patches where the hot sun hits them. This isn't a disease but heat damage. Ensure the plant has good leaf cover to shade the berries. In extreme heat, use shade nets (30% shade). Water frequently to keep the plants cool during peak afternoon heat."
Strawberry,Albinism (Physiological),"Fruit looks puffed and stays white/pink instead of turning red, and tastes bland. This happens due to too much Nitrogen fertilizer or cloudy weather during ripening. Reduce Urea/Nitrogen application during fruiting. Supplement with Potassium and Calcium to improve fruit color and firmness."
Strawberry,Catfacing / Nubbins (Physiological),"Fruit is deformed, twisted, or has a ""nub"" end. This is caused by poor pollination (lack of bees) or frost damage during flowering. Avoid using strong pesticides during bloom so you don't kill bees. If frost is expected, cover plants with row covers. Boron deficiency can also cause this, so a foliar Boron spray may help."
Potato,Gray Mold (Fungal),"Also called Botrytis. You will see grey, fuzzy mold on berries, usually after rain. Improve airflow by spacing plants well and weeding. Pick and bury rotting fruit immediately so spores don't spread. Avoid overhead watering. If rain is heavy during flowering, spray Cyprodinil + Fludioxonil (Switch), but keeping plants dry and mulched is the most effective cure."
Potato,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"Leaves curl upward like a cup and show white powdery dust underneath. This happens in humid conditions.

Sugarcane,Red Rot (Fungal),"Often called the ""Cancer of Sugarcane."" The plant dries up, and if you split the cane open, the inside is red with white cross-patches and smells like alcohol. Prevention is the only cure. Use resistant varieties (like Co 86032). Never plant seeds from a field that had Red Rot. Dip seed setts in Carbendazim (1g/liter) before planting. Rotate crops with rice or mustard for one season to break the cycle."
Sugarcane,Smut / Whip Smut (Fungal),"A long, black, dusty ""whip"" grows from the top of the plant. It looks like a burnt stick. Do not just cut it off! Gently cover the whip with a plastic bag before cutting it so the black dust (spores) doesn't fly onto other plants. Burn the bag. Remove the entire clump (roots and all). Treat seed setts with Propiconazole (1ml/liter) before sowing. Avoid keeping a ""Ratoon"" (second crop) if you had Smut."
Sugarcane,Wilt (Fungal),"The cane dries up and shrinks. If you cut it open, the center is hollow and light violet/brown. It usually happens when the plant is close to harvest. Avoid waterlogging; ensure your field drains well. Stop irrigation for a few weeks if you see wilting to reduce spread. Do not use seed from wilted fields. Apply Trichoderma viride (bio-fungicide) mixed with manure in the soil."
Sugarcane,Pokkah Boeng (Fungal),"The top leaves get twisted, wrinkled, and shortened. White or yellow patches appear at the base of leaves. It often happens in the rainy season. It usually recovers on its own, but if severe, spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). Adding micronutrients (Magnesium and Zinc) helps the plant recover faster."
Sugarcane,Grassy Shoot Disease (Phytoplasma),"The plant produces many thin, small, white/yellow shoots at the base, looking like grass instead of cane. It will not produce any sugar. This is spread by aphids. Heat Treatment is the best cure: treat seed setts with hot water (50°C) for 2 hours before planting. Dig out and burn infected clumps immediately. Do not take a ratoon crop from an infected field."
Sugarcane,Yellow Leaf Disease (Viral),"The midrib (center vein) of the upper leaves turns bright yellow, while the rest of the leaf stays green. Cane growth slows down. It is spread by aphids. Use Tissue Culture seedlings (virus-free) for planting. Spray Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter) to kill the aphids that spread it. Give the crop good fertilizer and water so it can tolerate the virus and still yield well."
Sugarcane,Pineapple Disease (Fungal),This attacks the seed setts after planting. The inside of the sett turns black and smells like ripe pineapple. The buds fail to sprout. This happens if the cut ends of the seed are not treated. Always dip the cut ends of your seed setts in a solution of Carbendazim or Propiconazole for 15 minutes before planting to seal the wound.
Sugarcane,Leaf Scald (Bacterial),"White ""pencil lines"" run along the leaf veins. Later, the leaf dries up and looks scalded (burned by hot water). The cane may sprout side shoots. Use certified disease-free seeds. Sterilize your harvesting knives with bleach or by heating them, as the bacteria spreads through tools. Remove infected plants immediately."
Sugarcane,Red Stripe (Bacterial),"Long, narrow red stripes appear on the leaves. If it moves to the top shoot, the top may rot (Top Rot) and smell bad. Since it is bacterial, fungicides won't work perfectly. Improve field drainage and avoid overhead sprinklers. You can spray Copper Oxychloride to limit the spread."
Sugarcane,Rust (Fungal),"Small, elongated orange or brown spots appear on the leaves. If you touch them, orange powder comes off on your finger. It happens in cool, humid weather. Usually, the sun kills it as the weather warms up. If severe, spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Propiconazole (1ml/liter). Remove weeds that block sunlight from reaching the lower leaves."
Sugarcane,Mosaic Virus (Viral),Leaves show a pattern of dark and light green patches (mottling). The cane stalks may split. It is spread by aphids and infected knives. There is no chemical cure. Use resistant varieties. The most important step is roguing: check your field frequently and pull out any young plants showing these symptoms early in the season.
Sugarcane,Ratoon Stunting (Bacterial),"You won't see clear symptoms on leaves, but the plant simply doesn't grow tall. The yield drops significantly in the ratoon (second) crop. The inside of the nodes may have orange/red dots. The only prevention is Hot Water Treatment of seeds (50°C for 2 hours) and sterilizing cutting knives with Lysol or bleach between fields."
Sugarcane,Iron Chlorosis (Physiological),"New leaves turn completely white or pale yellow/cream, but the veins might stay green. This is not a disease but a lack of Iron in the soil (common in calcareous/chalky soils). Spray Ferrous Sulphate (5g/liter) mixed with Citric Acid (1g/liter) on the leaves 2-3 times at 10-day intervals."
Ragi,Ragi Blast (Fungal),"The most dangerous disease. Look for spindle-shaped spots with grey centers on leaves. Spray Tricyclazole (0.6g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). If the ""neck"" or ""earhead"" turns black, spray immediately to save grains. Avoid over-using Urea; split your nitrogen doses. Use resistant seeds like GPU-28 or ML-365."
Ragi,Blight / Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small, oval, light-brown spots appear and can cover the whole leaf. Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) as soon as spots appear. This fungus hides on seeds, so treat them with Thiram or Captan (3g/kg) before sowing. Rotating the crop with legumes (like pulses) helps clean the soil naturally."
Ragi,Cercospora Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Shows as long, narrow brown spots. Heavy infection makes leaves look ""burnt."" Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). Ensure proper spacing between plants so sunlight can hit the lower leaves; sunlight is a natural killer for these fungal spores. Maintain soil fertility with organic manure."
Ragi,Downy Mildew (Fungal),"Leaves turn pale yellow and look ""shredded"" or twisted. The grain head turns into a bunch of green leaves instead of seeds. There is no cure once it reaches the earhead. Pull out and burn infected plants immediately. Prevent it by treating seeds with Metalaxyl (4g/kg) and ensuring the field is well-drained."
Ragi,Seedling Blight* (Fungal),"Young seedlings turn brown and die shortly after emerging. This is a soil-borne fungus. Drench the nursery area with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). To prevent it, always use raised beds for your nursery so water doesn't stand. Treat seeds with Trichoderma (10g/kg) to provide a biological shield against soil rot."
Ragi,Banded Leaf Blight* (Fungal),"Large, irregular ""bleached"" patches appear on the leaves, looking like bands. It spreads fast in very humid weather. Spray Hexaconazole (2ml/liter) or Propiconazole (1ml/liter). Keep the field free of weeds and avoid planting too densely. This fungus loves high humidity, so keeping the area airy is your best defense."
Ragi,Ragi Mottling Virus (Viral),Leaves show pale green or yellow streaks and a patchy appearance. The plant stays small and stunted. Spread by Aphids. You cannot cure the virus; you must kill the insects. Spray Neem oil (5ml/liter) or Dimethoate (1.7ml/liter). Pull out infected plants immediately to prevent the aphids from carrying the virus to healthy neighbors.
Ragi,Bacterial Leaf Streak (Bacterial),"Fine, transparent, water-soaked streaks along the leaf veins that eventually turn brown. Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (20g). Avoid working in the field when plants are wet. Adding Potash (Potassium) to your fertilizer schedule helps the leaf develop a tougher skin against these bacteria."
Ragi,Grain Smut* (Fungal),"While it affects grains, the first sign is often the darkening of the earhead tissues. Grains turn into green or black powdery sacs. Since it is seed-borne, seed treatment with Carbendazim (2g/kg) is the only effective way to stop it. If you see smutted heads, remove them carefully in a plastic bag and burn them."
Ragi,Foot Rot / Wilt (Fungal),Lower leaves turn yellow and the whole plant wilts and dries up. Drench the base of the plants with Carbendazim (2g/liter). The best prevention is to mix Trichoderma viride (2kg/acre) with compost and apply it to the soil before sowing. This beneficial fungus eats the disease-causing fungus in the ground.
Green Chilli,Chilli Leaf Curl Virus (Viral),"The leaves curl upward, become small, and look leathery. This is spread by Whiteflies. There is no chemical cure for the virus. Control the insects: install yellow sticky traps (15 per acre) and spray Neem oil (5ml/liter) or Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter). Pull out and bury infected plants immediately to save the rest of your field."
Green Chilli,Thrips Damage (Pest/Damage),"The leaves curl downward, looking like an inverted boat. The leaf veins turn silver or bronzed. This is caused by sap-sucking thrips. Spray Fipronil (2ml/liter) or Spinosad (0.5ml/liter). Use blue sticky traps. Keeping the field moist helps, as thrips thrive in dry, dusty weather."
Green Chilli,Dieback & Fruit Rot (Fungal),Tips of branches turn black and dry from the top downwards. It also causes small black dots on leaves. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Azoxystrobin (1ml/liter). Prune and burn the dead branch tips. Always treat seeds with Trichoderma before sowing to prevent this fungus from starting in the nursery.
Green Chilli,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"White, flour-like dust appears on the underside of leaves, while the top shows yellow patches. This happens in warm, dry weather. Spray wettable Sulfur (3g/liter) or Hexaconazole (2ml/liter). A simple home remedy is spraying a mixture of baking soda (5g/liter) and water. Ensure plants have enough space for air to flow."
Green Chilli,Cercospora Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small, circular ""frog-eye"" spots with white centers and brown borders appear. If not treated, leaves turn yellow and fall off. Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). Avoid high-density planting and remove fallen leaves from the field, as they harbor the fungal spores."
Green Chilli,Bacterial Leaf Spot (Bacterial),"Small, dark, greasy-looking spots appear on leaves. This causes heavy leaf drop during rainy seasons. Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (20g). Avoid overhead watering; use drip or furrow irrigation. Do not enter the field when the plants are wet to avoid spreading the bacteria."
Green Chilli,Choanephora Blight (Fungal),"Also called ""Wet Rot,"" young leaves and flower buds turn black and rot. They look like they are covered in tiny black pins. This happens in very humid weather. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). Improve field drainage and avoid over-using Nitrogen fertilizer, which makes the plant tissue too soft for the fungus."
Green Chilli,Mosaic Virus (Viral),"Leaves show a patchy ""mosaic"" of light and dark green. This is spread by Aphids. There is no cure; focus on killing the aphids using yellow sticky traps and spraying Thiamethoxam (0.3g/liter). Pull out and destroy infected plants. Always wash your hands with soap after touching a sick plant before touching healthy ones."
Green Chilli,Phytophthora Root Rot (Fungal),"Large, dark-brown water-soaked spots appear on leaves and the stem base rots. This happens during the monsoon. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter) and improve drainage immediately. Planting on raised beds is the best way to keep the plant's ""collar"" area dry and safe from this fungus."
Green Chilli,Anthracnose Spot* (Fungal),"Distinctive sunken black spots appear on leaves, which eventually turn into ""holes."" This is the same fungus that rots the fruit. Spray Propiconazole (1ml/liter) or Mancozeb (2.5g/liter). Ensure the field is clean of old plant debris. Mulching the soil with plastic or straw helps prevent soil-borne spores from splashing onto the lower leaves during rain."
Green Chilli,Gray Mold* (Fungal),"A fuzzy grey mold grows on leaves and flowers during cool, damp weather. It usually starts on wounded leaves. The best treatment is ventilation—prune extra leaves to let air move through. If severe, spray Carbendazim (1g/liter). Avoid using overhead sprinklers that keep the leaves wet for long periods."
Green Chilli,Fusarium Wilt (Fungal),"Lower leaves turn yellow and the whole plant wilts suddenly. Since this is a soil-borne fungus, drench the base of the plant with Carbendazim (2g/liter). The best prevention is to mix Trichoderma (2kg/acre) into your farmyard manure before planting. Ensure the field is not waterlogged, as the fungus loves wet, heavy soil."
Green Chilli,Southern Blight* (Fungal),"A white, ""cotton-like"" mold grows on the stem near the soil, and the leaves wilt rapidly. You may see small, mustard-seed-like structures on the mold. Drench the soil with a solution of Trichoderma. Deep summer plowing and soil solarization (covering soil with plastic in May) are very effective in killing this soil fungus before the next crop."
Green Chilli,Algal Leaf Spot* (Algal),"Orange or rust-colored velvety spots appear on the leaves. This is common in very humid, tropical areas. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). This usually happens when the plant is weak; ensuring proper fertilization (NPK) and good drainage will help the plant recover. It is more common in shaded parts of the field."
Cabbage,Black Rot (Bacterial),"You will see yellow ""V-shaped"" patches on leaf edges. Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (20g). Always use ""hot water treated"" seeds (50°C for 30 mins) to kill hidden bacteria. Avoid working in the field when plants are wet. This is the most serious cabbage disease in India; rotating crops for 2 years is essential."
Cabbage,Alternaria Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Dark-brown circular spots with ""target rings"" appear on leaves. Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Chlorothalonil (2g/liter). This fungus loves wet weather. Ensure good drainage and remove old, infected leaves. Rotating your cabbage with non-mustard family crops (like onions) for 2 years helps clean the soil and prevents the disease from returning next season."
Cabbage,Downy Mildew (Fungal),"Yellow patches appear on top of leaves with white, ""cottony"" growth underneath. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter). Avoid overhead watering that keeps leaves wet overnight. Thin out plants so air moves freely between the heads. This keeps leaves dry and stops the fungus. Start sprays early in the nursery stage if symptoms appear."
Cabbage,Clubroot (Fungal/Protist),"Leaves wilt during the day but ""recover"" at night. If you pull the plant, roots look swollen like ""clubs."" There is no chemical cure once it starts. The best treatment is to increase soil pH by adding Lime (Chuna) to the soil during land prep. Avoid planting cabbage or cauliflower in the same spot for at least 3 years to starve the soil fungus."
Cabbage,Bacterial Soft Rot* (Bacterial),"This causes a mushy, water-soaked rot on the head that smells very foul. It spreads fast in warm, wet weather through wounds. To treat, spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Streptocycline. Harvest only in dry weather and handle heads carefully to avoid scratches. Clear all plant debris after harvest. Rotating with corn or legumes helps reduce the bacteria in the soil."
Cabbage,Powdery Mildew* (Fungal),"White, flour-like powder appears on leaf surfaces, eventually covering them. Spray wettable Sulfur (3g/liter) or Dinocap (1ml/liter). This usually happens in dry, warm weather. A simple home remedy is a mixture of baking soda and water (5g/liter). Avoid using too much Nitrogen fertilizer, as it causes soft, ""juicy"" growth that the fungus finds very easy to infect."
Cabbage,White Rust (Fungal),"Shiny, white, ""blister-like"" spots appear on the underside of leaves. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Mancozeb (2g/liter). This usually appears during the winter months. Keep the field free of ""Mustard"" weeds, as the disease jumps from wild mustard to your cabbage. Ensure balanced fertilization and avoid heavy irrigation during cool mornings to keep leaves dry."
Cabbage,Black Leg (Fungal),"Circular, light-brown spots with tiny black dots appear on leaves. The stem near the ground turns black and rots. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter). Use healthy seeds and treat them with hot water before planting. Remove all ""cabbage trash"" after harvest, as the fungus survives in the stems. Deep summer plowing kills the spores hiding in the soil."
Cabbage,Cabbage Mosaic Virus (Viral),"Leaves show a patchy ""mosaic"" of light and dark green and may look wrinkled. Spread by Aphids. You cannot cure the virus; you must kill the aphids using yellow sticky traps and spraying Neem oil (5ml/liter). Pull out and bury infected plants immediately to prevent the insects from carrying the virus to healthy ones. Do not save seeds from infected plants."
Cabbage,Tipburn* (Physiological),"The edges of the inner leaves turn brown and dry. This is caused by a Calcium deficiency, often due to uneven watering. To fix, maintain steady soil moisture (don't let it get bone dry) and spray Calcium Nitrate (2-3g/liter) directly on the plant every 15 days. Avoid over-fertilizing with Potash or Nitrogen, as they can block the plant from drinking Calcium."
Cabbage,Head Splitting* (Physiological),"The cabbage head suddenly cracks open. This happens when heavy rain follows a dry spell; the plant drinks too much water too fast. Maintain uniform soil moisture with regular, small waterings. If a heavy rain is coming and your cabbage is already large, harvest it immediately before the rain starts. Mulching helps keep the soil moisture levels stable."
Cabbage,Wirestem* (Fungal),"The base of the stem on young plants turns dark, hard, and thin like a wire. This is caused by soil fungi (Rhizoctonia). Drench the soil with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). To prevent it, always use raised nursery beds to ensure good drainage. Mixing Trichoderma into your compost before planting provides a natural shield that protects the delicate stems from soil attack."
Brinjal,Little Leaf (Phytoplasma),"This is the most serious Indian brinjal disease. Leaves become tiny, crowded, and bushy; the plant stops fruiting. It is spread by leafhoppers. There is no cure for an infected plant—pull it out and bury it immediately. To prevent it, spray Dimethoate (2ml/liter) or Neem oil to kill the insects. Growing a border of maize or bajra helps block the leafhoppers."
Brinjal,Phomopsis Blight (Fungal),"You will see circular brown spots on leaves and soft, sunken rotted spots on fruits. To treat, spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). Always treat seeds with Thiram (3g/kg) before sowing. Remove and burn any infected fruits or leaves immediately to stop the fungal spores from flying to healthy plants."
Brinjal,Bacterial Wilt (Bacterial),"The plant suddenly droops and dies while still green. There is no chemical cure. Use resistant varieties like Arka Neelkanth. Before planting, dip seedling roots in a Pseudomonas fluorescens solution. Rotate your crop with grains like ragi or maize; never plant brinjal where you just grew tomatoes, chillies, or potatoes."
Brinjal,Cercospora Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small, circular yellow-brown spots appear on leaves. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter) or Mancozeb (2g/liter). This fungus loves high humidity and crowded plants. Ensure proper spacing so sunlight hits the lower leaves. Removing older, infected leaves from the bottom of the plant helps reduce the ""fungal load"" in your field."
Brinjal,Alternaria Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Look for dark-brown spots with ""concentric rings"" (like a target). Spray Chlorothalonil (2g/liter) or Mancozeb (2.5g/liter). Since the fungus survives on old plant debris, always clean your field after harvest. Deep summer plowing is very helpful in killing the spores hiding in the ground during the hot months."
Brinjal,Damping Off (Fungal),"This kills young seedlings in the nursery by rotting the stem at soil level. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride (4g/kg) before sowing. Always use raised nursery beds for better drainage. If you see rot, drench the soil with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). Keep the soil moist but never soggy."

Avoid working in fields when plants are wet to stop the bacteria from spreading."
Cauliflower,Downy Mildew (Fungal),"Yellow patches on top of leaves with white ""cottony"" growth underneath. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter). This happens in cool, humid weather. Thin out your plants so air can move freely. If it starts in the nursery, spray immediately to prevent taking the disease to the main field."
Cauliflower,Alternaria Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Dark brown/black circular spots with ""target rings"" appear on leaves and the curd (head). Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Chlorothalonil (2g/liter). This fungus loves wet weather. Ensure good drainage and remove old infected leaves. Rotating your crop with non-cabbage family plants for 2 years helps clean the soil."
Cauliflower,Clubroot (Fungal/Protist),"Leaves wilt during the day but ""recover"" at night. Roots look swollen and deformed like ""clubs."" There is no chemical cure once it starts. The best treatment is to increase soil pH by adding Lime (Chuna) during land preparation. Avoid planting cauliflower in the same spot for at least 3 years."
Cauliflower,Bacterial Soft Rot (Bacterial),"The curd turns into a mushy, foul-smelling liquid. It spreads fast in warm, wet weather through wounds. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). Harvest only in dry weather and handle heads carefully to avoid scratches. Clear all plant debris after harvest and rotate with corn or legumes to break the cycle."
Cauliflower,Whiptail (Physiological),"Leaves become very narrow, twisted, and ""thread-like."" This is a Molybdenum deficiency, common in acidic soil. To fix, apply Lime to the soil and spray Sodium Molybdate (1g/liter) on the leaves. It is a nutritional problem, so standard fungicides will not work."
Cauliflower,Hollow Stem / Browning (Physiological),"The stem becomes hollow and the head turns brownish. This is caused by Boron deficiency. Spray Borax (2g/liter) during the mid-growth stage. Avoid giving too much Nitrogen at once, as rapid growth makes the plant more likely to develop these hollow spaces."
Cauliflower,Damping Off (Fungal),"Young seedlings rot at the base and fall over in the nursery. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride (4g/kg) before sowing. Use raised beds to ensure water drains away. If rot appears, drench the soil with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). Allow the soil surface to dry between waterings."
Cauliflower,Sclerotinia Stem Rot (Fungal),"A white, ""fluffy"" mold grows on the base of the head or stem, turning it watery. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter). This disease loves high humidity. Avoid over-watering and ensure proper plant spacing for airflow. Solarise your soil in summer with plastic sheets to kill the resting spores before planting."
Cauliflower,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"White, flour-like powder appears on leaf surfaces. Spray wettable Sulfur (3g/liter) or Dinocap (1ml/liter). This happens in dry, warm weather. A simple home remedy is a mixture of baking soda and water (5g/liter). Avoid over-using Nitrogen, which creates soft growth that the fungus finds easy to infect."
Cauliflower,Black Leg (Fungal),"Circular, light-brown spots with tiny black dots appear on leaves; the stem near the ground turns black and rots. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter). Use healthy seeds and treat them with hot water. Remove all old plant debris after harvest. Deep summer plowing is very effective in killing the spores hiding in the soil."
Cauliflower,Cauliflower Mosaic (Viral),"Leaves show a patchy ""mosaic"" of light and dark green. Spread by Aphids. You cannot cure the virus; you must kill the aphids using yellow sticky traps and spraying Neem oil (5ml/liter). Pull out and bury infected plants immediately to prevent the insects from carrying the virus to healthy neighbors."
Cauliflower,Ricey / Fuzzy Curds* (Physiological),"The head looks ""fuzzy"" or loose like a flower. This is caused by high temperatures during the head-forming stage or over-maturity. Choose the right variety for your local climate. Harvest the curd as soon as it reaches its full size while it is still firm and white. Don't let it sit in the field too long."
Cauliflower,Blindness* (Physiological/Pest),"The plant grows leaves but fails to produce a curd (head). This is often caused by low temperatures or damage to the ""growing point"" by insects like the Diamondback Moth. Protect young plants from pests early. Use balanced fertilizers; sometimes very low temperatures during the early growth phase can ""blind"" the plant."
Cauliflower,Buttoning* (Physiological),"The plant produces a very tiny, useless head (""button""). This happens if the seedlings are too old when transplanted or if they face stress from lack of water or Nitrogen. Always transplant young, healthy seedlings (4-5 weeks old). Ensure the soil has enough Nitrogen and moisture from the very first day of planting."
Drumstick (Moringa),Twig Blight (Fungal),"Twig tips turn brown and dry up, moving down to the leaves. Spray Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). Prune affected branches 3 inches below the dead part and burn them. This prevents the fungus from reaching the trunk."
Drumstick (Moringa),Cercospora Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small, circular brown spots appear, leading to yellowing and leaf fall. Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter). Ensure trees are pruned to allow sunlight into the inner branches. Keep the base of the tree weed-free to reduce humidity."

Drumstick (Moringa),Pod Rot (Fungal),"Pods develop dark, sunken spots and turn soft. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter) during flowering. Avoid planting trees too close together and ensure water does not stand at the base, as wet roots invite pod-rotting fungi."
Drumstick (Moringa),Mosaic Virus (Viral),Leaves show patchy green patterns and become deformed. Spread by Aphids. No cure for the virus. Control aphids with yellow sticky traps and Neem oil sprays. Prune affected branches immediately or remove stunted trees to protect the rest.
Drumstick (Moringa),Root Rot (Fungal),"Leaves turn yellow and the tree wilts suddenly. Common in heavy, wet soils. Drench the root zone with a Trichoderma solution. Plant Moringa on mounds or raised bunds so water drains away from the trunk."
Drumstick (Moringa),Leaf Rust (Fungal),Small orange-to-reddish powdery spots on the underside of leaves. Spray Mancozeb (2.5g/liter) or Propiconazole (1ml/liter). Prune to improve airflow and apply Potash (Potassium) to help leaves resist the rust spores.
Drumstick (Moringa),Sooty Mold* (Fungal),"A black, ""sooty"" film covers the leaves. This is actually a fungus growing on the sticky ""honeydew"" left by insects like Mealybugs or Aphids. To treat, first kill the insects using Neem oil or soap spray. The mold will then dry up and flake off. Washing the leaves with a strong spray of water also helps."
Drumstick (Moringa),Bud Rot* (Fungal),"The flower buds turn brown, rot, and fall off before they can become pods. This is common during high humidity. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter) at the start of the flowering season. Avoid using too much Nitrogen, which makes the flower buds too soft and prone to rot."
Drumstick (Moringa),Crown Gall* (Bacterial),"Large, woody ""knots"" or swellings appear on the trunk or roots near the soil line. This is caused by soil bacteria entering through wounds. There is no cure. Avoid wounding the trunk during weeding. If a tree is heavily affected, remove it and do not plant Moringa in that same spot for 3 years."
Drumstick (Moringa),Diplodia Canker* (Fungal),"Dark, sunken areas (cankers) appear on the bark, sometimes oozing gum. The branch above the canker may die. Clean the wound and apply Copper Oxychloride paste. Avoid stress like drought or over-watering, which weakens the tree's ""skin"" and allows the fungus to enter."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Yellow Vein Mosaic Virus (YVMV) (Viral),The most destructive okra disease. Leaf veins turn bright yellow while the rest stays green. Spread by Whiteflies. There is no cure for the virus. Control whiteflies using yellow sticky traps (15/acre) and spray Imidacloprid (0.5ml/liter) or Neem oil. Pull out and bury infected plants immediately. Always use resistant varieties like Arka Anamika or Varsha Uphar.
Ladies Finger (Okra),Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"White, flour-like powder appears on both sides of the leaf. This happens in warm, dry weather. Spray wettable Sulfur (3g/liter) or Dinocap (1ml/liter). A home remedy is a mixture of baking soda and water (5g/liter). Avoid overcrowding plants to ensure good airflow, which naturally discourages the fungus."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Cercospora Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small, soot-like black spots on the underside of leaves, while the top shows yellow patches. Leaves eventually dry up and fall. Spray Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Carbendazim (1g/liter). Remove older, infected leaves from the bottom of the plant to stop the fungus from ""climbing"" up to the top."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Enation Leaf Curl (Viral),"Leaves become thick, leathery, and curl downwards with small ""warty"" growths (enations) on the underside. Spread by Whiteflies. Control whiteflies immediately and remove infected plants. Avoid planting okra near older, infected hibiscus or cotton plants, as they share the same virus."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Fusarium Wilt (Fungal),"The lower leaves turn yellow and the whole plant wilts suddenly, often starting from one side. This is a soil-borne fungus. Drench the soil with Carbendazim (2g/liter). The best prevention is to mix Trichoderma into your compost before planting. Avoid waterlogging, as the fungus moves easily through wet, heavy soil."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Damping Off (Fungal),"Affects young seedlings; the stem at the soil line rots and the plant falls over. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride (4g/kg) before sowing. Ensure your field has excellent drainage. If you see rot, drench the soil base with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). Avoid over-watering the young crop."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Root Knot Nematode (Parasitic),"The plant looks yellow and stunted; roots have small ""knots"" or swellings. Plant African Marigold between your okra rows. Apply Neem Cake (250kg/acre) during land preparation. Use the bio-agent Paecilomyces lilacinus in the soil to protect the roots."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Sooty Mold (Fungal),"A black, powdery layer covers the leaves. This grows on the ""honeydew"" (sticky liquid) left by Aphids or Mealybugs. To treat, kill the insects using Neem oil or soap spray. Once the insects are gone, the mold will dry up and wash away with water. It blocks the sun from reaching the leaf, reducing fruit yield."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Bacterial Leaf Spot (Bacterial),"Small, water-soaked spots appear on leaves that later turn brown with a yellow ""halo."" Spray Streptocycline (1g in 10L) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (2g/liter). This spreads through splashing rain. Avoid working in the field when plants are wet. Use drip irrigation to keep the leaves dry."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Collar Rot (Fungal),"A white, ""silky"" mold grows on the stem just above the soil line, and the plant wilts. You may see small, brown structures like mustard seeds. Drench the base with Copper Oxychloride (3g/liter). Avoid mounding wet soil too high against the stem. Deep summer plowing is very effective in killing the fungus in the soil."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Alternaria Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Dark brown circular spots with ""target rings"" appear on leaves. Spray Mancozeb (2.5g/liter). This usually attacks plants that are weak or lacking nutrition. Ensure balanced fertilization (NPK) to keep the plant's immune system strong. Clean up old crop debris after harvest to stop the fungus from overwintering."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Tobacco Streak Virus (Viral),"Causes dark, dead-looking (necrotic) streaks on leaves and stems. Spread by Thrips. Control thrips using blue sticky traps and sprays of Neem oil or Fipronil. Since there is no cure for the virus, removing the infected plant is the only way to save the rest of the field."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Phytophthora Blight* (Fungal),"Large, dark-brown water-soaked patches on leaves during very rainy seasons. It can also rot the pods. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter). Improve drainage immediately so water doesn't stand. Use raised beds for planting to keep the stem base dry."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Bract/Flower Rot* (Fungal),"The green bracts under the flower or the flowers themselves turn brown and rot, preventing fruit from forming. This is caused by high humidity. Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter). Ensure the plants are not too crowded. Avoid overhead sprinklers during the flowering stage."
Ladies Finger (Okra),Yellowing/Fruit Drop* (Physiological),"While not a ""disease,"" it causes leaves to turn yellow and small fruits to fall off. This is often caused by a lack of Micronutrients or sudden temperature changes. Spray a mixture of Micronutrients (2g/liter) and maintain steady soil moisture. Do not let the soil get bone dry and then flood it with water."
Onion,Purple Blotch (Fungal),"Look for purple centers inside water-soaked spots on leaves. Spray Mancozeb (2.5g/liter) or Hexaconazole (2ml/liter). This is the most common onion disease in India. Avoid over-watering and late-season Nitrogen, as it makes leaves too soft. Rotating with Maize or Soybean is highly effective."
Onion,Downy Mildew (Fungal),"Pale yellow patches on leaves with a purplish-white ""fuzzy"" growth. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter). This happens in cool, humid weather. Avoid overhead irrigation in the evening; morning watering allows the sun to dry the leaves quickly."
Onion,Stemphylium Blight (Fungal),"Small yellowish spots that grow into large brown, elongated patches. Spray Tebuconazole + Trifloxystrobin (0.5g/liter). This fungus loves high humidity (90%+). Keep the field clean and ensure proper spacing. It often follows Purple Blotch, so treating for one usually helps prevent the other."
Onion,Onion Twister / Colletotrichum (Fungal),"Leaves become twisted and elongated like a ""snake,"" and the bulb stays tiny. Spray Propiconazole (1ml/liter). This is soil-borne. Mix Trichoderma viride into your manure before planting. Avoid planting in fields where ""Twister"" occurred in the last 2 years."

Solarize your soil in summer with plastic sheets to kill the ""seeds."""
Bottle Gourd,Phytophthora Blight (Fungal),"The whole vine develops large, dark, ""greasy"" water-soaked patches and collapses overnight during heavy monsoons. Treatment: Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb (2g/liter) or Cymoxanil (2g/liter). This is a ""water mold."" Ensure your raised beds are at least 1 foot high and that water never touches the main stem ""collar"" of the plant."
Bottle Gourd,Nitrogen Deficiency (Nutritional),"Old leaves turn light green or yellow, starting from the tips. The whole plant looks ""pale."" Treatment: Apply Urea or Ammonium Nitrate to the soil. For a quick fix, use a foliar spray of 1% Urea (10g in 1L water). This is often mistaken for a virus; if the veins stay green, it is usually a nutrient issue, not a germ."
Bottle Gourd,Boron Deficiency (Nutritional),"Fruits become crooked, deformed, and the skin looks ""corky"" or cracked. The growing tips of the vine may also die back. Treatment: Spray Borax (2g/liter) or Solubor once during the start of flowering. This is very common in sandy soils or after heavy rain that washes nutrients away."
Bottle Gourd,Blossom End Rot (Physiological),"The bottom of the gourd (where the flower was) turns black, dry, and leathery. Treatment: This is caused by Calcium deficiency linked to irregular watering. Maintain a steady water schedule (don't let the soil go from bone-dry to flooded). Spray Calcium Nitrate (5g/liter) on the young fruits."
Bottle Gourd,Phomopsis Blight* (Fungal),"Small circular grey spots on leaves and soft, light-brown sunken rot on the fruit. Treatment: Spray Carbendazim (1g/liter).

Prevention: Install yellow sticky traps (15/acre) and spray Neem Oil (5ml/liter) or Acetamiprid early in the morning to kill whiteflies."
Sponge Gourd,Sclerotium Stem Rot (Fungal),"A thick white mold grows around the base of the stem at the soil line. You will see small, round, brown structures (sclerotia) that look like mustard seeds. Treatment: Drench the base with Hexaconazole (2ml/liter). This fungus loves high humidity and heavy manure. Ensure the soil around the stem is well-aerated."
Sponge Gourd,Witches' Broom (Phytoplasma),"The plant produces many tiny, crowded leaves instead of normal vines, looking like a ""broom."" Spread by Leafhoppers. Treatment: No cure. Pull out and destroy the plant. Prevention: Control leafhoppers using Dimethoate (2ml/liter). Keeping the field free of wild weeds like Parthenium (Congress grass) is vital as they harbor the phytoplasma."
Sponge Gourd,Black Rot (Fungal),"The stem turns black and mushy, especially near the joints (nodes). This usually happens during the height of the rainy season. Treatment: Spray Carbendazim + Mancozeb (2g/liter). Avoid over-application of Urea, which makes the stems soft and juicy, attracting this fungus."
Sponge Gourd,Sooty Mold (Fungal),"A black, powdery layer covers the leaves. This is not a direct disease but a fungus growing on the sticky ""honeydew"" left by Aphids or Mealybugs. Treatment: Kill the insects first. Once the insects are gone, the mold will dry up and wash off with water. The mold hurts the plant by blocking sunlight."
Sponge Gourd,Macrophomina Root Rot (Fungal),"The roots and lower stem turn dark brown, and the bark can be easily peeled off to reveal tiny black specks. The plant wilts suddenly. Treatment: Drench the soil with Carbendazim (2g/liter). This disease thrives in ""heat stress""—when the soil is very hot and dry, then suddenly becomes wet. Mulching helps keep soil temperatures steady."
Sponge Gourd,Blossom Drop (Physiological),"The flowers turn yellow and fall off before fruit can form. Treatment: This is often caused by a lack of Micronutrients or very high temperatures. Spray a Micronutrient Mix (2g/liter) containing Boron and Zinc. Also, ensure there are enough bees in the field for pollination; avoid spraying pesticides during the daytime when bees are active."
Sponge Gourd,Fruit Bitterness (Physiological/Environmental),"The sponge gourd develops a very bitter taste. Treatment: This is caused by high levels of ""Cucurbitacins,"" triggered by drought stress or sudden high heat. Maintain a consistent watering schedule and ensure the soil is rich in organic matter to buffer the plant against heat."
