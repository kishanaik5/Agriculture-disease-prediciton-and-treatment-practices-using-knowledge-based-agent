Fruit Common Name ,Disease Name (Type),Treatment Methods
Almond,Hull Rot,"This is a very common problem where the outer shell (hull) rots after it splits, often causing the nearby leaves and twigs to die. It is caused by too much nitrogen or water. To stop this, reduce irrigation and Nitrogen fertilizer slightly when the hulls start splitting (harvest time). Spray Iprodione or Boscalid fungicides at the early hull-split stage. Harvest early to prevent the fungus from producing poisons that kill the branches."
Almond,Brown Rot,"This fungus attacks the flowers and young nuts, turning them soft and brown. The infected nuts often stick to the branch and dry up (mummies). You must remove and destroy these ""mummy"" nuts during winter cleaning. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter when the flower buds turn pink and again at full bloom. If it rains during flowering, an extra spray is necessary."
Almond,Anthracnose,"Orange or rust-colored sunken spots appear on the young nuts. During wet weather, the nuts produce a lot of gum and may fall off. Prune out dead branches and remove infected nuts. Spray Azoxystrobin or Propiconazole @ 1 ml per liter during the pink bud stage and repeat every 10-14 days if rains continue during spring. This disease can kill the nut completely if not treated early."
Almond,Almond Scab,"Grey to black, oily-looking spots appear on the hulls (outer shells). If the infection is severe, the hull does not open properly, and the kernel inside remains small. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Ziram @ 2 grams per liter starting two weeks after the petals fall. Repeat the spray every 2 weeks until the shell hardens. Prune the tree to allow air to dry the nuts quickly after rain."
Almond,Bacterial Spot (Shot Hole),"Small, water-soaked spots appear on the hull, which later produce amber-colored gum. This can damage the kernel inside causing it to look gummy or dark. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Bordeaux mixture (1%) during the dormant season (winter). Once leaves appear, use Ziram or Mancozeb instead of Copper to avoid burning the leaves."
Almond,Navel Orangeworm Damage,"This is the worst pest for almonds. The worm enters the nut after the hull splits and eats the kernel, leaving behind web and black waste. The most important step is ""Winter Sanitation"": knock down all old nuts (mummies) remaining on trees in winter and destroy them, as the worms hide there. Harvest as soon as 100% of hulls have split. Spray Spinosad or Methoxyfenozide at hull split if necessary."
Almond,Gummosis (Leaffooted Bug),"You will see clear, jelly-like gum oozing from the nuts. When you cut the nut, the kernel inside has a dark spot or is dead. This is caused by bugs piercing the nut, not a fungus. Monitor the orchard for Leaffooted Bugs or Stink Bugs. Spray Permethrin or Bifenthrin if you see many bugs in the spring. Removing weeds around the orchard prevents these bugs from breeding near the trees."
Almond,Kernel Mold,"The kernel inside the shell develops a grey or black mold, making it bitter and unsafe to eat. This usually happens if rain gets inside the split hull during harvest. Harvest the nuts as soon as they are ready; do not leave them on the tree after the hulls open. If rain is forecast during harvest, try to pick the nuts early. Dry the harvested nuts immediately to stop mold growth."
Amla,Amla Rust (Ring Rust),"Black, circular blisters or rings appear on the fruit skin, which spoils the look and quality of the fruit. To control this, spray Wettable Sulphur @ 3 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter during the early fruiting stage. If the infection is severe, repeat the spray after 15 days. Always buy disease-free seedlings to prevent this from entering your orchard."
Amla,Internal Necrosis (Browning),"The fruit looks healthy from the outside, but when you cut it, the flesh inside is brown or black. This is not a fungus but caused by a lack of the nutrient Boron. To fix this, spray Borax @ 6 grams per liter of water. You should do this three times: once when flowers appear, again when fruits are pea-sized, and finally when fruits are half-grown."
Amla,Soft Rot (Blue Mold),"This usually happens after harvest or if fruits get injured on the tree. The infected part turns soft, brown, and watery, sometimes with a blue-green mold. Handle fruits very gently during harvest to avoid cuts and bruises. Dip the harvested fruits in a weak salt solution (sodium chloride) or Borax solution (borax @ 1 gram per liter) to clean them and protect against rotting during storage."
Amla,Fruit Borer,"A small caterpillar bores a hole into the fruit and eats the seed, causing the fruit to rot and fall. Collect and destroy all fallen, infested fruits to break the cycle. Spray Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter or Quinalphos @ 2 ml per liter when fruits are starting to develop. You can also hang light traps to catch the moths that lay the eggs."
Amla,Anthracnose (Fruit Spot),"Brown, sunken spots appear on the fruit surface, which may join together to form large rotten patches. This is common in humid weather. Prune the tree to allow sunlight to reach the fruits. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during the fruit setting stage. Keep the ground clean of fallen leaves."
Amla,Dry Rot (Phoma Rot),The fruit develops dark brown to black spots that become hard and dry. The skin may wrinkle. This often happens if the tree is weak. Ensure the tree gets enough water and fertilizer. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter if you see spots appearing on young fruits.
Apricot,Brown Rot,"This is the most common disease where the fruit turns soft, brown, and gets covered in dusty grey fungal powder. The fruit rots completely and may dry up (mummify) on the branch. To stop this, you must pick and burn all the dried ""mummy"" fruits hanging on the tree during winter. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter when the flowers open and again 2 weeks before harvesting to protect the fruit from rotting."
Apricot,Coryneum Blight (Shot Hole),"Small, purple-red spots appear on the fruit skin, which later turn into rough, scabby bumps. The fruit looks spotted and ugly. This fungus lives in infected buds and twigs. Prune out dead wood and infected branches during winter. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Bordeaux Mixture (1%) just before the buds swell in spring and again after the petals fall to protect the young fruit."
Apricot,Apricot Scab (Freckles),"Small, round, olive-green to black velvet spots appear on the fruit skin. These spots usually stay on the surface but make the fruit look dirty and reduce its price. It happens in damp, shady conditions. Prune the tree to let more sunlight reach the center. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Captan @ 2 grams per liter when the shucks (flower covers) fall off the young fruit. Repeat the spray after 15 days."
Apricot,Bacterial Spot,"Dark, sunken spots appear on the fruit, often causing deep cracks and pits. Sticky gum may ooze out of these spots. This is harder to control than fungal diseases. Plant resistant varieties if possible. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during the dormant season (winter). Be careful using Copper after leaves appear as it can burn them; use agricultural antibiotics like Streptocycline only if recommended by local experts."
Apricot,Powdery Mildew,"White powdery patches appear on the young green fruit. As the fruit grows, these spots disappear but leave behind hard, rusty-brown, rough patches (russeting) on the skin. To prevent this roughness, spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Myclobutanil @ 0.5 ml per liter as soon as the petals fall. Keep the orchard weed-free to reduce humidity."
Apricot,Ring Pox (Viral Disease),"Dark, reddish-purple rings or irregular blotches appear on the fruit surface. The fruit becomes bumpy and deformed. The flesh inside may have dead, brown streaks. There is no chemical spray to cure this virus. The only solution is to remove the infected tree to save the others. Use only certified virus-free saplings when planting new trees."
Apricot,Rhizopus Rot (Soft Rot),"This rot hits the ripe fruit after harvest. The fruit turns very soft, watery, and develops a ""whiskery"" black mold. It enters through cuts and bruises. Handle apricots very gently; do not throw them into crates. Cool the fruit immediately after picking. Dip the fruit in a recommended post-harvest fungicide like Fludioxonil or simply maintain strict hygiene and cool storage temperatures."
Apricot,Earwig Damage,"These are insects, not a disease, but they cause damage that looks like rot. They hide in the clusters and chew holes in the ripening fruit, causing it to rot. Trap them by wrapping corrugated cardboard or damp newspaper around the tree trunk; the insects will hide there during the day, and you can remove and burn the traps. Keep the area around the tree trunk clean of weeds and debris."
Arecanut,Koleroga (Fruit Rot / Mahali),"This is the most dangerous disease during the monsoon. Dark water-soaked spots appear on the nut surface near the cap, and the nuts rot and fall in large numbers. To control this, cover the bunches with polythene covers (Kotte) before the rains start to keep them dry. Spray Bordeaux Mixture (1%) just before the monsoon begins. If rains are heavy, repeat the spray after 45 days. Collect and burn all fallen, rotting nuts to stop the fungus from spreading."
Arecanut,Inflorescence Dieback,"The flower stalks and young buttons start drying from the tip backwards, turning dark brown or black. This causes severe shedding of baby nuts. Prune off the dried, infected parts of the bunch and burn them. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter just after the female flowers open. Apply balanced fertilizers (Potash) to strengthen the tree against this drying."
Arecanut,Button Shedding,"Young nuts (buttons) fall off excessively without any obvious rot. This can be due to a lack of pollination or nutrients. Ensure your garden has proper drainage during the rainy season and irrigation during summer. Apply Borax @ 20 grams per tree mixed with soil. If shedding continues, spray NAA (Planofix) @ 1 ml in 5 liters of water on the opening bunches to help hold the nuts."
Arecanut,Nut Splitting,"The nuts crack open while still on the tree, spoiling the quality. This is usually not a disease but happens when a long dry spell is followed by sudden heavy rain or over-watering. To prevent this, maintain constant soil moisture by watering regularly in summer and using mulch (dry leaves) at the tree base. Spray Borax @ 2 grams per liter on the bunches when nuts are developing. Improve drainage to remove excess water quickly."
Arecanut,Pentatomid Bug (Tender Nut Drop),"A small bug punctures the tender nuts to suck sap. The nuts turn yellow, shrivel, and fall. If you look closely at fallen nuts, you will see tiny pin-prick holes. Spray Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter or Dimethoate @ 1.5 ml per liter on the young bunches. Keep the plantation clean of weeds where these bugs hide."
Arecanut,Inflorescence Caterpillar,"You will see sticky webs and frass (waste) on the flower bunch. The caterpillar bores into the nuts and flower stalks, causing them to dry. Open the bunches manually to clean out the webs and worms. Spray Malathion @ 2 ml per liter or Quinalphos @ 1.5 ml per liter when you first see the webbing. Using light traps at night can help catch the moths before they lay eggs."
Arecanut,Sun Scorch (Golden Yellow Nuts),"The nuts exposed to the harsh afternoon sun (South-West side) turn golden yellow, develop cracks, and the kernel inside becomes black and hard. This is not a fungus but heat damage. Cover the exposed bunches with areca leaf sheaths or opaque polythene covers. Plant tall shade trees on the South-Western border of the garden to block the direct sun."
Banana,Anthracnose (Black Spot / Ripe Rot),"Handle the fruit bunches carefully during harvest and transport to avoid any bruises or cuts, as this is where the rot starts. Remove and destroy any decaying leaves or infected fruits from the plantation. After harvesting, dip the banana hands in a Carbendazim solution (1 gram per liter) or hot water (50°C) for 5 minutes before storing to prevent the black spots from developing."
Banana,Cigar End Rot (Burnt Tip),"Immediately after the fruits have formed, manually remove the dried flower parts (pistils) hanging at the tip of the banana fingers, as these attract the fungus. Cover the bunches with polyethylene sleeves (bunch covers) to protect them. If you see the infection starting, spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter on the bunches."
Banana,Crown Rot (Stalk Rot),"Keep your harvesting knives and tools very clean and sharp. Cut the banana hands leaving a clear portion of the crown (stalk) attached. Immediately after cutting, dip the cut ends of the crown in a solution of Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or apply a mixture of Alum and water to the cut surface. Allow the surface to dry completely before packing to stop the rot from entering the stalk."
Banana,Fruit Rust / Scab (Thrips Damage),"This reddish-brown roughness on the skin is caused by tiny insects called thrips. Place blue sticky traps in the field to catch them. Cover the banana bunches with polythene bags as soon as the last hand opens to block the insects. If the attack is severe in the early stages, spray Imidacloprid @ 0.5 ml per liter or Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter on the young bunches."
Banana,Bacterial Soft Rot / Finger Rot,"This rot often happens when fruits are damaged or sun-scorched. Maintain good shade in the garden and ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging. Remove and bury any rotting fruits far away from the field. When washing harvested bananas, use clean water mixed with a little chlorine (bleaching powder) to kill surface bacteria and dry the fruits well before packing."
Banana,Banana Scarring Beetle Damage,"Keep the plantation clean by removing weeds and grass where beetles hide. When the banana bunch starts forming, ensure the leaves do not touch the fruits, as beetles use leaves as bridges to reach the bunch. Bagging the bunches (covering with plastic) at the early shooting stage is the most effective method. You can also spray Chlorpyrifos @ 2.5 ml per liter on the young bunch once before bagging."
Banana,Moko Disease (Fruit Pulp Rot),"This bacterial disease causes the inside pulp to turn brown and dry even if the outside looks okay. Always use clean, sterilized tools for pruning and harvesting, as the bacteria spreads through knife blades. Remove the male flower bud (bell) using a forked stick instead of a knife to prevent infection. If a plant is infected, destroy the entire plant and do not replant banana there for at least 12 months."
Ber,Powdery Mildew,"A white, powdery coating covers the young fruits, which later turns brown and corky. The fruits stop growing, shrink, and fall off early. To control this, spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Dinocap @ 1 ml per liter as soon as you see flowers. Repeat the spray twice at 15-day intervals when the fruits are setting. Prune the tree properly to let sunlight in, as shade spreads this disease."
Ber,Fruit Rot (Alternaria/Phoma),"Small, light brown spots appear on the lower part of the fruit. These spots grow larger, turn dark brown or black, and the fruit pulp inside becomes soft and rotten. This happens mostly in humid weather. Collect and bury all fallen, rotting fruits to keep the orchard clean. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Zineb @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are developing (pea stage) to protect them."
Ber,Fruit Borer (Worm),"This is the biggest problem for Ber. A small caterpillar enters the fruit and eats the seed, filling the inside with black waste. The fruit turns reddish-brown and falls. Collect and burn every single fallen fruit because the worm is hiding inside the soil or fruit. Dig the soil around the tree in summer to kill sleeping pests. Spray Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter or Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter when fruits are small (pea-sized). Do not spray when fruits are ready for harvest."
Ber,Sooty Mold (Black Coating),"A black, velvet-like layer covers the fruit skin, making it look dirty and fetching a low price. This happens because of sticky waste from insects like mealybugs and scale insects. First, kill the insects by spraying Dimethoate @ 1.7 ml per liter. Then, spray a Starch solution (2%) or spray plain water with high pressure to wash off the black mold. The mold will flake off once the insects are gone."
Ber,Fruit Cracking,"The fruit skin splits open, usually near the harvest time. This happens if you water the trees heavily after a long dry period. It is not a germ but a water management issue. Maintain regular moisture in the soil by watering frequently in small amounts rather than flooding once a month. Spray Borax @ 3 grams per liter when fruits are developing to make the skin elastic and strong."
Ber,Rust (Fruit Infection),"While rust usually attacks leaves, in severe cases, small reddish-brown pustules appear on the fruit skin, spoiling its look. The leaves will also look rusty and fall. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter. Since this disease survives on old leaves, sweep and burn the fallen leaves from the orchard floor during winter pruning."
Cashew,Tea Mosquito Bug (Gida Heenu / TMB),"This is the most damaging cashew pest in India. It sucks juice from apples and nuts, causing black scabs and shriveled nuts. Start spraying early at flowering using Thiamethoxam or Lambda-cyhalothrin. Repeat after 15 days if needed. Remove badly damaged fruits. Avoid excess urea, as soft growth attracts bugs. Early control protects both apple quality and nut yield."
Cashew,Anthracnose (Kole Roga / Blossom & Fruit Blight),"Common during rainy and cloudy weather. Black sunken spots appear on apple and nut, leading to early fruit drop. Collect and destroy infected fruits regularly. Prune overcrowded branches for airflow. Spray Carbendazim or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter during flowering and early fruit stage. Clean orchard and timely spraying greatly reduce yield loss."
Cashew,Cashew Apple Rot (Kolu Roga / Fruit Rot),"Apples become soft, watery, and may show white or pink fungal growth, especially during heavy rains. Improve drainage and avoid water stagnation. Remove rotten apples immediately from the field. Spray Copper Oxychloride or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter. Harvest fruits on time and never allow ripe apples to remain on wet soil."
Cashew,Nut Borer (Kayi Koreyuva Hulu),"The insect makes small holes in the nut and feeds inside, leaving black waste outside. Collect fallen and damaged nuts daily and destroy them. Spray Emamectin benzoate or Lambda-cyhalothrin at early nut formation stage. Keep orchard clean and avoid leaving nuts on the ground, as this increases pest multiplication."
Cashew,Nut Sealing / Black Mold (Aspergillus / Penicillium),"Mainly occurs after fruit fall and during drying. Inside the nut, black powdery fungus develops due to moisture. Collect nuts daily and dry them properly under sunlight. Never dry nuts on wet soil. Store only fully dried nuts in clean, dry, well-ventilated rooms. Proper drying is the cheapest and most effective control."
Cashew,Cercospora Fruit Spot (Chukke Roga),"Small brown spots appear on cashew apples, making them hard and unmarketable. Disease spreads under humid conditions. Avoid dense planting and ensure good sunlight inside canopy. Remove infected apples. Spray Carbendazim or Propiconazole @ 1 g per liter at early stage. Balanced fertilizer and good air circulation reduce disease severity."
Cashew,Phoma Fruit Blight (Dry Rot),"Apples and nuts develop hard, dry, black patches and stop growing. Common in humid regions. Remove infected fruits and prune dense branches. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter during flowering and early fruit stage. Maintain orchard hygiene and avoid excess moisture to prevent recurrence."
Cashew,Inflorescence Die-back,"Entire flower and fruit bunch dries before fruits develop properly. Avoid moisture stress during flowering. Remove dried bunches and destroy them. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 2 g per liter at early flowering. Balanced nutrition, timely irrigation, and avoiding excess nitrogen help plants recover and support healthy fruit setting."
Cashew,Pink Mold Rot (Trichothecium Rot),"Cashew apples develop soft rot with a clear pink powdery fungal layer, especially during wet weather. Remove infected apples immediately. Improve drainage and avoid late-evening irrigation. Spray Mancozeb or Carbendazim @ 2 g per liter. Harvest fruits on time and keep apples off wet ground to stop spread."
Cashew,Grey Mold (Botrytis Fruit Rot),"Grey fuzzy mold appears on ripe apples during cool, humid weather. Harvest fruits on time and remove rotten ones. Avoid overhead irrigation late in the day. Spray Carbendazim or Hexaconazole @ 1 g per liter. Good sunlight, airflow, and orchard cleanliness reduce disease naturally."
Cashew,Sunscald (Heat Injury – Not a Disease),White or bleached patches appear on apples due to strong sunlight. Maintain good leaf cover and avoid heavy pruning. Use mulching and proper irrigation to reduce heat stress. Balanced fertilizer helps maintain healthy canopy. Shade and moisture management are the best solutions.
Cashew,Secondary Rots (After Bird / Insect Damage),"Fungal rots enter through cracks, bird pecks, or insect wounds. Use bird nets if needed. Handle fruits carefully during harvest. Remove damaged fruits quickly. Dry and store nuts properly. Hot-water dipping of fruits (48–50°C for 2–3 minutes) helps reduce post-harvest rot."
Cashew ,Powdery Mildew,"A white, powdery fungus covers the young cashew apples and nuts. The skin turns rough and corky, and the apple may split open or fall early. This happens mostly in cloudy weather. Dust the trees with Sulphur dust (20 kg per hectare) or spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter during the flowering stage. Pruning the trees to let sunlight in helps kill the fungus naturally."
Cashew ,Dieback (Inflorescence Blight),"The flower stalks and young apples start drying from the tip downwards, turning brown or black. This often happens alongside the Tea Mosquito Bug attack. Prune the dried, dead branches and burn them. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter to stop the rot from moving down to the healthy apples."
Cashew ,Gummosis (Fruit Gumming),"A sticky, amber-colored gum oozes out from the cashew apple or nut surface. The apple becomes deformed and poor in quality. This is often due to fungal infection entering through insect wounds. Improve drainage in the orchard. Scrape off the gum and apply Bordeaux paste on the trunk/branches. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter to protect the developing fruits."
Coconut,Mahali (Fruit Rot / Nut Fall),"This fungal disease causes young buttons and immature nuts to fall off in large numbers, especially during the monsoon. You will see dark green lesions near the stalk (calyx) of the fallen nut. To control it, clean the crown of the tree before the rains start. Spray 1% Bordeaux Mixture on the bunches and leaves. If the rain is heavy, repeat the spray after 45 days. Apply Bordeaux paste to the crown to stop the rot from entering."
Coconut,Eriophyid Mite Damage,"This is a major problem where triangular, pale yellow patches appear on the young nuts near the stalk. As the nut grows, these turn into brown, rough, wart-like patches with deep cracks. The nuts remain small and deformed. To treat this, mix 10 ml of Azadirachtin (1% formulation) with 10 ml of water and feed it to the tree through a root (Root Feeding). Alternatively, spray Neem Oil @ 20 ml per liter or Palm Oil + Sulphur mixture on the bunches 3 times a year. Apply proper fertilizer (Potash) to make the tree strong."
Coconut,Button Shedding,"Tiny baby coconuts (buttons) fall off in large numbers before growing. This is often due to a lack of water, nutrients, or poor pollination. Ensure regular irrigation during summer; do not let the soil dry out. Apply 500 grams of Potash and 200 grams of Borax per tree per year. If shedding continues, spray NAA (Planofix) @ 2 ml in 10 liters of water on the flower bunches 30 days after the flower opens."
Coconut,Coreid Bug Damage,"A bug punctures the tender buttons and young nuts to suck sap. This causes sticky gum to ooze out from the nut. The nuts become deformed, crinkled, and smaller in size. Many buttons fall off. Collect and burn fallen, immature nuts. Spray Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter or Azadirachtin (Neem) @ 5 ml per liter on the young bunches. Keep the garden clean to reduce hiding spots for the bugs."
Coconut,Root (Wilt) Disease (Quality Loss),"While this is a whole-tree disease, it severely affects the fruit. The nuts become smaller, the shell becomes thinner, and the kernel (copra) does not harden properly and tastes bland. There is no cure, but you can manage it. Remove severely infected trees that yield less than 10 nuts/year. For other trees, apply balanced organic manure (50 kg) and Magnesium Sulphate (500g) per year to improve nut quality. Grow intercrops like cocoa or banana to improve soil health."
Coconut,Barren Nuts (Empty Nuts),"The nut grows to full size, but when you open it, there is no kernel or water inside; it is empty or cracked. This happens due to poor pollination or Potash deficiency. Ensure there are bee colonies nearby for pollination. Apply extra Potash (Muriate of Potash) @ 2 kg per tree per year along with common salt (1 kg). Regular watering during the nut development stage prevents this."
Coconut,Thanjavur Wilt (Ganoderma),"The lower leaves droop and fall, and the tree sheds all its buttons and immature nuts. The trunk may bleed a rusty liquid. This is a root rot fungus. Dig a trench around the infected tree to stop roots from touching healthy trees. Apply 5 kg of Neem Cake mixed with Trichoderma (bio-fungicide) to the soil every year. Drench the soil around the tree with 40 liters of Bordeaux Mixture (1%)."
Coconut,Crown Choke,"The tip of the nut becomes constricted or choked, leading to deformation. This is usually caused by Boron deficiency. Apply Borax @ 200 grams per tree per year in the soil ring. Ensure the soil moisture is maintained, as dry soil prevents the tree from absorbing Boron."
Cotton,Bacterial Blight (Boll Rot Phase),"This disease is caused by bacteria, so normal fungicides alone are not enough. Mix Streptocycline 2 g + Copper Oxychloride 500 g in 200 liters of water per acre and spray uniformly. Repeat spraying every 15 days if black spots continue. Avoid overhead irrigation and remove badly infected bolls to stop the disease from spreading further."
Cotton,Anthracnose (Red Rot),"This fungal disease spreads fast in moist weather. Keep proper spacing between plants so sunlight dries the bolls quickly. At the first sign of red or brown spots, spray Carbendazim 0.1% or Mancozeb 0.25%. Do 3 sprays at 15-day intervals during boll formation. Avoid excess irrigation and remove infected bolls from the field."
Cotton,Fungal Boll Rot (Diplodia / Grey Mildew),"This rot usually enters through insect damage. First, control bollworms properly. Do not allow the crop to grow too dense. During continuous rains, spray Copper Oxychloride 0.3% or Mancozeb 0.2% on developing bolls. Ensure good drainage in the field. Removing infected bolls early helps reduce further spread of the fungus."
Cotton,Internal Boll Rot (Stigmatomycosis),"Once this disease enters the boll, it cannot be cured. Prevention is the only solution. Control cotton stainers and green bugs using recommended insecticides like Imidacloprid. Keep the field and bunds free from weeds where insects hide. Use traps if available. Healthy, insect-free crops greatly reduce the chance of internal boll rot."
Cotton,Tirak (Bad Opening),"This problem occurs due to lack of nutrients or water stress. Apply extra nitrogen fertilizer during flowering stage. If soil is sandy, provide regular irrigation during September–October so bolls develop properly. Avoid moisture stress at boll development stage. Balanced fertilization and timely watering help bolls open normally with good quality cotton."
Cotton,Alternaria Boll Spot,"Strong plants resist this disease better. Apply sufficient Potash and Magnesium fertilizers. At early signs of brown or black spots, spray Propiconazole 0.1% or Mancozeb + Carbendazim mixture. Remove and burn infected leaves and fallen bolls. Avoid continuous cotton cropping and maintain clean field conditions to prevent recurrence."
Cotton,Tobacco Streak Virus (Cotton Necrosis),"This is a viral disease and cannot be cured. Control the Thrips insects that spread it. Treat seeds with Imidacloprid 7 g/kg before sowing. If thrips appear, spray Thiamethoxam or Dimethoate. Remove weeds like Parthenium from the field and borders, as they act as virus sources."
Cotton,Ascochyta Blight (Wet Weather Blight),"This disease appears during long wet and cloudy conditions. Improve field drainage to avoid water stagnation. If wet weather continues, spray Copper Oxychloride 0.3% or Zineb. Remove infected bolls if possible. Crop rotation with cereals like maize next season helps clean the soil and reduces disease carry-over."
Cotton,Myrothecium Spot (Ring Spot Disease),"Collect and burn infected bolls and leaves immediately. Spray Carbendazim 1 g/liter or Mancozeb 2.5 g/liter for good control. Since the fungus often enters through insect wounds, maintain proper insect control. Avoid working in wet fields, as wounds made during wet conditions increase disease spread."
Cotton,Diplodia Boll Rot (Black Smut Rot),"Carefully remove black, sooty bolls and destroy them to stop spore spread. Avoid injuring plants during weeding or interculture. Spray Copper Oxychloride as a preventive measure, especially after rain. Maintain good field hygiene and insect control, as this disease mainly attacks already damaged bolls."
Cotton,Rhizopus Rot (Soft Watery Rot),"There is no chemical cure once the boll becomes soft and watery. Harvest cotton as soon as bolls open and do not delay picking. Control bollworms properly because the fungus enters through insect holes. Avoid storing harvested cotton in hot, humid conditions to prevent further rotting during storage or transport."
Custard Apple,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"This disease causes round, black, sunken spots on the fruit, which may eventually turn the whole fruit black and hard. To control it, keep the orchard clean by removing and burning all falling or infected fruits. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are small. After harvest, handle fruits gently to avoid injuries that allow the rot to start."
Custard Apple,Diplodia Rot (Black Fruit Rot),"The fruit turns completely black, becomes hard like a stone, and dries up (mummifies) on the tree. This usually happens to fruits that are already injured. Prune dead twigs and remove any dried ""mummy"" fruits hanging on the tree. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during fruit development. Ensure you harvest carefully without pulling the fruit stem roughly."
Custard Apple,Black Canker / Fruit Canker,"Rusty or black irregular spots appear on the fruit skin, making it look rough and reducing its market value. Prune the canopy to allow sunlight to reach the fruits. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Bordeaux Mixture (1%) just after fruit set. Repeat the spray after 20 days if the weather is humid to protect the developing skin."
Custard Apple,Mealybug Damage (White Patch),"While this is a pest, it causes a disease-like condition where white cottony masses cover the fruit, often leading to a sticky black mold (Sooty Mold). Keep the orchard free of weeds like Parthenium where these bugs hide. Destroy ant nests near the trees as ants protect mealybugs. Spray Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter or Profenofos @ 2 ml per liter. Washing harvested fruits with water usually removes the white fuzz."
Custard Apple,Fruit Borer (Caterpillar),"The caterpillar bores into the fruit, creating holes and filling them with waste, which causes the fruit to rot and smell bad. Collect and destroy any fruits with holes immediately. Spray Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter or Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter when fruits are young (marble-sized). Bagging the fruits with cloth or paper bags when they are small is the best chemical-free way to stop this."
Custard Apple,Alternaria Fruit Spot,"Small, dark brown to black spots appear on the fruit surface, specifically during the rainy season. Remove weeds and keep the base of the tree clean to reduce humidity. Spray Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter or Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter during the fruit growth stage. Ensure proper spacing between trees so air can flow freely and dry the fruits quickly after rain."
Custard Apple,Stone Fruit (Mummification),"Sometimes fruits stop growing, become very hard (stone-like), and turn brown. This can be due to irregular watering or fungal attack. Maintain constant soil moisture by watering regularly and using mulch (dry grass) around the tree base. Spraying a general fungicide like Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter helps if the cause is fungal."
Date Palm,Inflorescence Rot (Khamedj),"This disease attacks the flower bunches before they open. The spathe (cover) develops rusty-brown spots, and the flowers inside rot and turn black. To save the crop, collect and burn all infected spathes immediately. Spray the tree with Bordeaux mixture (1%) or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter just before the spathes emerge in early spring. Dusting the flower clusters with a mixture of Sulphur and Copper fungicide is also effective."
Date Palm,Fruit Rot (Spoilage / Souring),"In humid weather or after rain, the fruits turn soft, smell sour like vinegar, and fall off. This is caused by yeast and fungi. To prevent this, cover the bunches with paper bags or wire mesh rings to allow air circulation. Avoid over-crowding the fruits; thin them out so they don't touch each other. Spray a safe fungicide like Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter only if heavy rains occur during the ripening stage."
Date Palm,Black Scorch (Medjnoon),The fruit stalks and young fruits turn black and look like they have been burned by charcoal. The fruit dries up and hardens. Prune and burn all infected leaves and fruit stalks. Apply Copper Oxychloride paste on the cut wounds. Spray the heart of the palm and bunches with Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Thiophanate Methyl @ 1 gram per liter to kill the fungus.
Date Palm,Blacknose (Physiological),"The tip of the fruit turns dark (blackish) and dries out, while the rest of the fruit remains normal. This is not a fungus but happens due to humidity changes. Avoid heavy thinning of the bunch too early. Place wire rings inside the bunch to separate the strands and improve airflow. Ensure regular irrigation so the tree does not face water stress."
Date Palm,Checking (Fruit Cracking),"Small, horizontal cracks appear on the fruit skin, usually near the tip. This happens when high humidity or rain occurs just before harvest. Cover the bunches with water-resistant paper bags or plastic hoods during the ripening phase to keep them dry. Do not water the trees heavily just before the harvest."
Date Palm,Lesser Date Moth,"A small worm bores into the young fruit near the calyx (cap), eating the seed and causing the fruit to turn red-brown and fall. You will see silk webbing connecting the fruits. Collect and destroy all fallen fruits. Spray Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) @ 1 gram per liter or Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter when the fruits are small. Bagging the bunches early with fine mesh nets prevents the moth from laying eggs."
Date Palm,Date Scale (White Scale),"Small white or grey scales cover the fruit surface, making it look shriveled and unmarketable. The fruit stops growing. Prune heavily infested old leaves (fronds) and burn them. Spray mineral oil (Horticultural oil) @ 10 ml per liter or Azadirachtin (Neem) @ 5 ml per liter to smother the scales. Scrubbing harvested dates with water can remove the scales if the infection is mild."
Fig,Fig Endosepsis (Internal Rot / Pink Rot),"The fruit looks normal outside, but inside the pulp is soft, watery, and rot varies from pink to brown. This fungus is carried into the fig by the pollinating wasp. To control this, you must keep the orchard very clean. Collect and destroy all ""mummy"" figs (dried figs) hanging on the trees or on the ground during winter. If you are using caprifigs for pollination, ensure they are treated or cleaned as recommended by local experts to reduce the fungus carried by wasps."
Fig,Souring (Sour Rot),"The fruit starts smelling like vinegar or alcohol. A pink liquid bubbles out from the eye (opening) of the fig, and the skin turns soft and mushy. This is caused by yeasts and bacteria spread by vinegar flies and dried fruit beetles. Harvest the fruits daily and do not let over-ripe figs stay on the tree. Control the flies by using traps and keeping the orchard free of rotting waste. Avoid overhead irrigation that keeps the fruit wet."
Fig,Fig Smut,"The inside of the fruit is filled with a black, powdery soot. You might not see it until you open the fruit. This fungus enters through the eye of the fruit when it opens. Remove and bury all infected and dried fruits immediately. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during fruit development. reduce dust in the orchard as dust carries the fungal spores."
Fig,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"Small, sunken, dark brown spots appear on the fruit skin. In humid weather, these spots grow larger and may have pinkish sticky spores. The fruit rots and drops. Prune the tree to allow sunlight and air to dry the leaves and fruits quickly. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are small. Repeat after 15 days if it rains."
Fig,Fig Mosaic Virus,"The fruit develops yellow spots or patterns, becomes deformed, and may drop early. The size of the fruit remains small. This virus is spread by tiny mites. There is no chemical cure for the virus itself. The only solution is to use disease-free cuttings for planting. To stop the spread, control the mites by spraying Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or a specific miticide like Abamectin."
Fig,Fruit Cracking,"The skin of the fruit splits open, usually near the eye. This happens when there is heavy rain after a dry spell or if you water the plants irregularly. It is not a disease but makes the fruit rot easily. Maintain constant soil moisture by watering regularly; do not let the soil dry out completely. Apply a thick layer of mulch (dry grass) around the base of the tree to hold moisture. Spraying Calcium Chloride @ 2 grams per liter can help strengthen the skin."
Fig,Sunburn,"The side of the fruit facing the hot sun turns dry, tough, and brown. The fruit stops growing and becomes leathery. This usually happens in summer. Maintain a good canopy of leaves to shade the fruits by providing proper water and fertilizers. You can also whitewash the trunk and main branches to reflect heat. In extreme heat, cover exposed fruits with a light cloth or paper bags."
Fig,Rust (Fruit Infection),"While rust mostly affects leaves, severe infection can cause small, rusty reddish spots on the fruit skin, making it look bad. The fruit may ripen prematurely and fall. Collect and burn fallen leaves. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter. Controlling rust on the leaves will automatically protect the fruit."
Grapes,Anthracnose (Bird's Eye Spot),"Prune and burn the infected canes and dried berries immediately to stop the fungus from spreading to new fruits. Apply Bordeaux paste on the cut ends after pruning. During the fruit setting stage, spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter. If it rains frequently, use a sticker with the spray to ensure the medicine stays on the fruit."
Grapes,Downy Mildew (Leather Berry),"Keep the vineyard well-ventilated by removing excess leaves around the bunches so that sunlight and air can dry them quickly. If rains occur during berry formation, immediately spray systemic fungicides like Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Fosetyl-Al @ 2 grams per liter. Ensure the soil drains well, as high moisture triggers this disease rapidly."
Grapes,Powdery Mildew (Berry Cracking),"Dusting Sulphur @ 20 kg per hectare during the cool morning hours is very effective in preventing this disease. If you see white powder on the berries, spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or specialized fungicides like Penconazole or Hexaconazole @ 0.5 to 1 ml per liter. Keep the canopy open to let sunlight hit the bunches, which kills the fungus naturally."
Grapes,Botrytis Bunch Rot (Gray Mold),"Remove dead flower caps and trash from the bunch immediately after fruit set, as the fungus starts growing on dead matter. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilizers which make the canopy too dense. Spray specific fungicides like Fenhexamid or Iprodione just before the bunches close and at the beginning of ripening. Handle bunches carefully during harvest to avoid wounds."
Grapes,Black Rot (Mummy Berry),"Collect and burn all the shriveled, hard, black ""mummy"" berries hanging on the vines or fallen on the ground, as they carry the disease to the next season. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Myclobutanil beginning when shoots are 10 inches long and continue until the berries start changing color. Keep the vineyard weed-free to reduce humidity."
Grapes,Sour Rot (Vinegar Rot),"Since this rot is spread by fruit flies and vinegar flies, control them by using traps or spraying insecticides like Deltamethrin only if necessary and safe. Prevent berries from cracking by maintaining regular irrigation and avoiding sudden heavy watering. Do not injure the berries during cultural operations. Remove rotting bunches immediately to prevent the smell from attracting more flies."
Grapes,Blue Mold (Storage Rot),This usually attacks grapes after harvest or in storage. Handle the bunches very gently to prevent skin breakage or berry detachment. Cool the grapes immediately after harvest to slow down fungal growth. Fumigate the storage room with Sulphur dioxide pads (grape guards) inside the packaging boxes to keep the berries fresh and free from mold during transport.
Grapes,Rhizopus Rot (Soft Rot),"Prevent the fruit skin from breaking, as this fungus only enters through wounds. Keep the harvested grapes in a cool, dry place and ensure good air circulation in the packing shed. Dip the bunches in a safe post-harvest fungicide if recommended for your variety, or simply ensure strict hygiene and rapid cooling to stop the soft, leaking rot from destroying the crate."
Guava,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"Keep the orchard clean by collecting and burying all falling or rotting fruits deep in the soil. Prune dead twigs and branches where the fungus hides. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter just before the rainy season and again when fruits are developing. After harvest, do not pack any fruits with injuries to prevent rotting in the box."
Guava,Canker (Scab),"Prune the tree branches to prevent overcrowding and allow sunlight to reach the fruits, as dampness encourages this disease. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Zineb @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are small (pea-sized). Repeat the spray twice at 15-day intervals to prevent the rough, corky, raised spots from forming on the skin."
Guava,Stylar End Rot,"This rot starts at the bottom (flower end) of the fruit. Improve the cleanliness of the garden and remove any dead twigs or dried fruits immediately. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter as soon as the fruit sets. Ensure the fruits are not touching wet soil, as this rot often starts from soil fungi splashing onto the fruit."
Guava,Fruit Fly Damage (Maggots),"Hang Methyl Eugenol Pheromone traps (8-10 per acre) in the orchard to catch the male flies. Regularly collect and destroy all fallen, infested fruits by burying them deep underground to kill the maggots. Do not spray insecticide directly on the fruit; instead, spray a bait mixture of Jaggery and Malathion on the tree trunk or old leaves to attract and kill the flies."
Guava,Red Rust (Algal Spot),"This appears as dark green or reddish-brown velvet spots on the fruit. Provide good fertilizer and water to keep the tree strong, as weak trees get this disease easily. Prune the branches to allow air circulation. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter during early summer or when you first see the spots on the fruits."
Guava,Phytophthora Fruit Rot,"Ensure good drainage in the orchard so water does not stagnate, as this rot spreads rapidly in wet conditions. Support the lower branches so fruits do not touch the wet ground. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during the rainy season if you see brown rotting spots with white mold on the fruits."
Guava,Grey Blight (Scabby Rot),"This causes large, brown, scabby patches on the fruit. Remove and burn infected leaves and fruits to reduce the source of infection. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter during the fruiting stage. Keeping the tree healthy with proper nutrition helps it resist this blight."
Indian Raspberry,Botrytis Fruit Rot (Gray Mold),"This is the most common disease in berries. The ripe fruit becomes soft, mushy, and gets covered in a fuzzy grey mold. It spreads quickly if fruits touch each other. To control this, harvest the fruits every day as soon as they ripen; do not let them get over-ripe. Prune the bushes to allow wind to dry the fruits. Refrigerate the fruits immediately after picking. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Fenhexamid during flowering, but avoid spraying near harvest time."
Indian Raspberry,Anthracnose (Sunken Berry),"Small, purple spots appear on the fruit, causing individual seeds (drupelets) to turn brown, shrink, and dry up. The fruit becomes hard and misshapen. This fungus lives on old canes. Prune and burn all old, dead canes (branches) immediately after harvest. Spray Lime Sulphur during the dormant season (winter). When new canes are growing, spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter to protect the fruit before it forms."
Indian Raspberry,Late Leaf Rust (Fruit Infection),"While this is called leaf rust, it severely affects the fruit. You will see yellow-orange powdery masses on the fruit, making it look dusty and inedible. The fruit may ripen unevenly. Remove and burn the fallen leaves and old fruiting canes. Keep the area weed-free. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter before the flowers open. Do not spray Sulphur when the temperature is very high as it burns the fruit."
Indian Raspberry,Sun Scald (White Drupelets),Groups of seeds (drupelets) on the fruit turn white or bleached and become soft. This happens on the side of the fruit facing the hot afternoon sun. It is not a disease but heat damage. Ensure the plant has enough leaves to shade the berries. Water the plants regularly to keep them cool. Use a shade net (30% shade) over the crop during the peak summer afternoon hours to protect the quality.
Indian Raspberry,Crumbly Berry,The fruit falls apart into pieces when you pick it. It does not hold together like a whole berry. This can be caused by a virus (spread by nematodes in soil) or poor pollination. There is no spray to cure the virus. Test your soil for nematodes before planting. Buy only certified virus-free plants. Ensure there are enough bees for pollination; avoid spraying insecticides when bees are active during flowering.
Indian Raspberry,Raspberry Fruitworm,"Small yellow-white worms bore into the fruit, feeding on the fleshy part and the center (receptacle). The fruit rots or dries up. The adult beetles feed on flower buds first. Hand-pick the beetles if you see them on buds. Spray Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter or Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter just before the blossoms open to kill the adults before they lay eggs on the fruit."
Jackfruit,Rhizopus Rot (Soft Rot),"This is the most damaging disease where young fruits turn soft, rot quickly, and get covered in a grey, hairy fungal growth before turning black and falling off. To control it, clean the tree by removing and burying all fallen or rotting fruits immediately. Spray Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter when the fruits are young. Bagging the young fruits with polythene covers is very effective in preventing this rot."
Jackfruit,Anthracnose (Brown Spot),"Dark brown spots appear on the fruit skin, which may enlarge and cause the skin to crack or rot, especially during humid weather. Prune the tree to remove dead branches and improve airflow around the fruits. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during the fruit setting stage. Keep the orchard floor clean from fallen leaves and debris."
Jackfruit,Pink Disease (Stalk Rot),"A pink, crusty coating appears on the branches and spreads to the fruit stalk, causing the fruit to dry up and die. Cut and burn the infected branches and fruit stalks immediately to stop the spread. Apply Bordeaux Paste on the cut ends. Spray the tree with Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Bordeaux mixture (1%) before and after the monsoon rains."
Jackfruit,Fruit Bronzing (Red Discoloration),"The fruit skin turns reddish-brown or bronze in color, and the pulp inside may become hard or tasteless. This is often caused by bacteria or nutrient imbalance. Ensure the tree gets balanced fertilizers, specifically Potash. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter if you suspect bacterial infection. Maintain regular watering and avoid water stress during fruit development."
Jackfruit,Jackfruit Borer (Shoot & Fruit Borer),"A caterpillar bores into the fruit, flower buds, and stem, causing rotting and dropping of the fruit. You can often see holes with waste material coming out. Collect and burn all affected buds and fruits. Spray Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter or Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter during the flowering and early fruiting stage. Covering the fruit with bags prevents the moth from laying eggs on the skin."
Jackfruit,Dieback (Botryodiplodia Rot),"Twigs and fruit stalks dry up from the tip downwards, often leading to fruit drying. Prune the affected twigs well below the drying point and apply Bordeaux paste on the cut surface. Spray Thio-phanate Methyl @ 1 gram per liter or Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter to protect the remaining fruits and branches."
Lemon,Citrus Canker,"Brown, raised, corky spots appear on the fruit skin, which look like small craters. In severe cases, the fruit cracks and falls. To control this, cut and burn infected twigs before the monsoon. Spray a mixture of Streptocycline (1 gram) and Copper Oxychloride (10 grams) in 10 liters of water. Spray this three times during the rainy season at 20-day intervals. Using windbreaks around the orchard also helps reduce the spread."
Lemon,Citrus Scab,"Rough, corky, warty projections appear on the fruit surface, making it look deformed and ugly. It is common in sour limes. Prune the infected parts to reduce the source of infection. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter when new flush and flowers appear. Repeat the spray when fruits are pea-sized."
Lemon,Gummosis (Brown Rot),"Fruits near the ground turn brown, leathery, and rot with a bad smell. This happens due to water stagnation. Improve drainage in the orchard so water does not stand near the tree trunk. Paint the trunk with Bordeaux paste. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Fosetyl-Al @ 2 grams per liter on the tree and soil during the rainy season."
Lemon,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"Dark brown, dry spots appear on the fruit skin, often forming ""tear stains"" where water drips down. The fruit may rot at the stem end and drop. Remove dead twigs and dried branches. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter twice: once at flowering and again when fruits are developing."
Lemon,Green / Blue Mold,"This is a storage disease. A soft, watery spot appears on the fruit, which quickly gets covered in green or blue powder. It enters only through wounds. Handle lemons very gently during harvest; do not pull them, clip them. Wash fruits with clean water containing a little chlorine or dip them in a Carbendazim (0.5 gram per liter) solution before packing."
Lemon,Fruit Cracking,"The fruit skin splits open, usually due to irregular watering or Boron deficiency. Maintain constant soil moisture by watering regularly; do not let the soil dry out completely and then flood it. Spray Borax @ 4 grams per liter or Calcium Nitrate @ 2 grams per liter when fruits are pea-sized to strengthen the skin."
Lemon,Sooty Mold (Black Coating),"A black, sticky powder covers the fruit, reducing its market value. This is caused by insects like aphids and whiteflies. Spray Starch solution (2%) on the fruits; when it dries, it peels off with the black mold. To solve the root cause, control the insects by spraying Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter or Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter."
Lemon,Stylar End Rot,"A soft, brown rot starts at the tip (nipple) of the lemon and spreads upwards. This often happens in hot weather due to water stress. Ensure the tree is watered deeply and regularly during the summer. Avoid nitrogen fertilizer during the fruit development stage. Spraying 2,4-D @ 20 ppm (very small amount) can help reduce this drop in some varieties."
Mango,Anthracnose (Black Spot / Fruit Rot),"Collect and burn all fallen or infected fruits to stop the disease from spreading. During flowering and when small fruits appear, spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter of water. After harvesting, dip the fruits in hot water (52°C) for 10 minutes to prevent them from rotting during storage."
Mango,Bacterial Canker (Cracked Fruit),Immediately cut and burn any infected branches and fruits to keep the orchard clean. Protect fruits from wind damage since wounds allow bacteria to enter. Mix Streptocycline (1 gram) and Copper Oxychloride (10 grams) in 5 liters of water and spray this mixture three times during the rainy season to control the spread.
Mango,Powdery Mildew,"Prune dense branches to allow sunlight and air to reach the fruits, as this reduces the disease naturally. When flowers and small fruits first appear, spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Hexaconazole @ 1 ml per liter. If the infection is severe, repeat the spray after 15 days."
Mango,Stem End Rot,"Harvest fruits carefully by cutting them with a 1 cm stalk using a clipper or scissor, and do not pull them by hand. Ensure fruits do not touch the soil after harvest. To prevent rotting, spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter on the trees 15 days before harvesting."
Mango,Sooty Mold (Black Coating),"Control the insects (hoppers/aphids) that cause this mold by spraying Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter. To clean the fruit, wash it with clean water after harvest. Alternatively, spray a solution of Starch (Maida) @ 20 grams per liter on the tree; when it dries, the starch will peel off, taking the black mold with it."
Mango,Black Tip (Coal Fume Damage),"Plant mango orchards at least 1.5 km away from brick kilns to avoid smoke damage. Spray Borax @ 6 grams per liter or Washing Soda @ 10 grams per liter of water. Do this three times: first when flowers appear, second when fruits are marble-sized, and third when fruits are half-grown."
Mango,Fruit Fly Damage (Maggots),"Set up Methyl Eugenol Pheromone Traps (10 traps per acre) to catch the male flies. Collect and bury any falling, rotting fruits deep in the soil to kill the maggots inside. Do not spray insecticide directly on the fruit; instead, spot spray a bait mixture of Jaggery and Malathion on the tree trunk or old leaves."
Mango,Mango Malformation (Bunchy Fruit),"Cut off the bunched, deformed floral parts or vegetative shoots as soon as you see them and burn them. In the month of October, before flowering starts, spray NAA (Planofix) @ 1 ml in 4.5 liters of water to encourage healthy fruit formation."
Mango,Scab,"Prune the tree to improve air circulation and sunlight. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are small (pea-sized) to protect the skin from rough, corky spots. Repeat the spray if the weather is very humid."
Mango,Red Rust (Algal Spot on Fruit),Provide the tree with balanced fertilizers to keep it strong. Prune overcrowding branches to let light in. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Bordeaux Mixture (1%) during the early summer or when spots first appear on the fruit surface.
Mulberry,Popcorn Disease (White Fruit),"This is the most common specific disease where the individual berries swell up, turn hard, and become greenish-white, looking exactly like popped corn. The fruit becomes inedible and does not ripen. To control this, collect and burn all the infected, fallen white fruits from the ground, as the fungus survives there. Spray Bordeaux mixture (1%) or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter when the trees are blooming (flowering) to prevent the fungus from entering the young fruit."
Mulberry,Botrytis Rot (Gray Mold),"The ripening fruit turns soft, brown, and watery. In humid weather, it gets covered in a fuzzy grey mold. This usually happens if the fruits are too crowded or if it rains during harvest. Prune the tree to allow sunlight and air to reach the inner branches. Harvest the fruits immediately as they ripen; do not leave them on the tree. Spraying Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Captan @ 2 grams per liter during fruit setting can help, but stop spraying well before harvest to keep the fruit safe to eat."
Mulberry,Sclerotinia Rot (Dry Rot),"The fruit shrivels, turns dry and hard, and often falls off early. Sometimes a white cottony growth appears on the fallen fruit. This fungus lives in the soil. Clean the orchard floor by removing weeds and plant debris. Do not throw soil onto the plant during weeding. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter during the flowering stage to protect the developing berries."
Mulberry,Fruit Rust,"While rust mostly attacks leaves, it can also infect the fruit, causing small, orange, powdery spots on the berry surface. The fruit may deform or drop. Collect and burn infected leaves and fruits. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter. Since this disease spreads from old leaves, keeping the garden clean during winter pruning is the best prevention."
Mulberry,Bacterial Blight (Black Rot),"Small, water-soaked, black spots appear on the fruit. The fruit eventually turns completely black and rotten. This spreads fast in rainy seasons. Prune and burn the infected branches. Spray Streptocycline (0.5 gram) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (2 grams) per liter of water. Avoid overhead watering (sprinklers) as splashing water spreads the bacteria from leaf to fruit."
Muskmelon,Fruit Rot (Wet Rot / Pythium),"The fruit becomes soft, water-soaked, and covered with white cottony fungus, especially where it touches damp soil. The fruit collapses quickly. To prevent this, use plastic mulch or place dry straw under the fruits so they do not touch the wet ground. Improve drainage in the field to avoid standing water. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter if heavy rains occur during the fruiting stage."
Muskmelon,Anthracnose,"Shallow, sunken, circular spots appear on the fruit skin, which may produce pinkish sticky material during humid weather. The fruit rots later in storage. Remove and burn old vines and rotting fruits to keep the field clean. Spray Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter or Thiophanate Methyl @ 1 gram per liter during fruit development. Cool the fruits immediately after harvest to stop the fungus from growing."
Muskmelon,Sun Scald (Sunburn),"Large white or bleached patches appear on the top of the fruit exposed to direct sunlight. The skin becomes thin, weak, and rot enters easily. Maintain a healthy leaf canopy to shade the fruits by providing proper fertilizers. Cover exposed fruits with dry straw, newspaper caps, or the plant's own leaves during the peak summer heat to protect the skin from burning."
Muskmelon,Fusarium Fruit Rot,"The fruit develops soft spots that may turn into white or pink moldy patches, often starting at the stem end or where the fruit sits on the soil. Use resistant varieties if available. Harvest carefully by cutting the stem with a clipper rather than pulling it. Dip the fruit in hot water (55°C) for 2 minutes after harvest to clean the skin. Avoid injuring the fruit during weeding."
Muskmelon,Bacterial Fruit Blotch,"Small water-soaked spots appear on the fruit skin, which enlarge and cause the rind to crack and the flesh to rot. Use only certified disease-free seeds. If you see symptoms, spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter mixed with Streptocycline immediately. Avoid using overhead sprinklers as water splashing spreads the bacteria from leaf to fruit."
Muskmelon,Fruit Fly Damage,"The fruit looks good outside but has maggots (worms) inside the pulp, causing it to rot and smell bad. You may see tiny puncture marks on the skin. Hang ""Methyl Eugenol"" pheromone traps (10 per acre) to catch the male flies. Collect and bury all fallen fruits deep in the soil. Spray a bait of Jaggery and Malathion on the leaves (not on the fruit) to kill the adult flies."
Muskmelon,Mosaic Virus (Fruit Deformity),"The fruit becomes bumpy, mottled with dark and light green patches, and deformed. It tastes bad and cannot be sold. This is spread by aphids (greenflies). Remove and destroy weeds around the field where insects hide. Pull out and bury infected plants immediately. Spray Imidacloprid @ 0.5 ml per liter or Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter to control the aphids and stop the spread."
Orange,Citrus Gummosis (Brown Rot / Foot Rot affecting fruit),"Fruits develop brown, leathery rot with bad smell, especially in poorly drained orchards. Improve drainage and avoid water stagnation near trunks. Remove infected fruits and affected bark. Apply Bordeaux paste on trunk base. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter during rainy periods. Keep orchard clean and avoid injuries to fruits and trunk."
Orange,Citrus Scab,"Rough, raised, corky scabs form on fruit skin, reducing market value. Prune and destroy infected twigs and fruits. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 2 g per liter or Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter during new flush and early fruit development. Avoid overhead irrigation. Good spacing and sunlight reduce humidity and help control the disease naturally."
Orange,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"Black sunken spots appear on fruits during humid and rainy weather, leading to rotting and early drop. Collect and destroy infected fruits regularly. Avoid water splash on fruits. Spray Carbendazim or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter during flowering and early fruit stage. Pruning dense branches improves air circulation and reduces disease spread."
Orange,Green Mold (Penicillium Rot),This post-harvest rot enters through wounds and causes soft rot with green powdery growth. Harvest fruits carefully to avoid injuries. Remove damaged fruits immediately. Keep storage areas clean and dry. Dip fruits in hot water (48–50°C for 2–3 minutes) or spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter to reduce storage losses.
Orange,Blue Mold (Penicillium italicum),"Similar to green mold but with bluish fungal growth. Occurs mainly during storage and transport. Avoid rough handling and keep fruits dry. Maintain cool, well-ventilated storage. Remove infected fruits quickly. Hot-water treatment or Carbendazim spray helps reduce spread. Hygiene during harvesting and packing is the best prevention."
Orange,Sour Rot (Geotrichum Rot),"Fruits develop soft, watery rot with sour smell, especially in warm and humid conditions. Avoid fruit injuries and harvest at proper maturity. Improve drainage and orchard sanitation. Remove infected fruits immediately. Dip harvested fruits in hot water or spray Copper fungicides. Clean storage and quick marketing reduce losses."
Orange,Stem-End Rot,"Rot starts near the stem end of fruit and spreads inward. Caused by fungi entering through harvest wounds. Harvest fruits with clippers, not by pulling. Avoid stacking wet fruits. Remove infected fruits. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter before harvest. Proper handling and dry storage are key to control."
Orange,Fruit Drop (Physiological / Stress-related),"Fruits turn yellow and fall early due to moisture stress, nutrient imbalance, or pest attack. Ensure regular irrigation and avoid drought stress. Apply balanced fertilizers, especially potassium. Spray NAA (Planofix) @ 1 ml per 4.5 liters during fruit set. Control insects like aphids and mites to improve fruit retention."
Orange,Sunburn / Sunscald,White or bleached patches develop on fruit due to strong sunlight and heat stress. Maintain good leaf cover and avoid heavy pruning. Use mulching and proper irrigation during hot months. Shade nets can be used in extreme heat. Balanced nutrition helps maintain canopy and protects fruits from direct sun exposure.
Orange,Sooty Mold (Secondary Fruit Problem),"Black, soot-like coating forms on fruit surface due to honeydew from insects like aphids and whiteflies. Control insects using Neem oil @ 3 ml per liter or suitable insecticides. Wash fruits to remove soot. Managing insect pests automatically prevents sooty mold and improves fruit appearance."
Orange,Alternaria Fruit Rot / Black Rot,"Dark brown to black spots appear on mature fruits, leading to rot during humid weather. Remove infected fruits from the orchard. Avoid water splash during irrigation. Spray Mancozeb or Chlorothalonil @ 2 g per liter at early symptom stage. Good orchard sanitation and airflow reduce disease pressure."
Orange,Phytophthora Fruit Rot,Fruits touching wet soil rot quickly during rainy season. Improve drainage and avoid water stagnation. Use mulching to keep fruits off the ground. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter during prolonged rains. Remove fallen and infected fruits immediately to stop spread.
Paddy,Neck Blast (Benki Roga / Rotten Neck),"If you notice brown or black spots on the neck of the rice panicle, stop using urea immediately, as too much nitrogen increases the disease. When the panicle starts coming out, spray Tricyclazole @ 0.6 g per liter of water. For prevention, soak seeds in Pseudomonas liquid before sowing. This improves plant strength and helps the crop fight disease naturally."
Paddy,False Smut (Gantu Roga / Lakshmi Roga),"Spray Propiconazole or Copper Oxychloride just before the grain head comes out of the leaf (boot stage). This timing is very important to stop disease spread. If you see yellow or green ball-like growth on grains, collect them from the field and burn them. Do not throw them on the bunds, as they can spread infection to the next crop."
Paddy,Udbatta Disease (Udbatta Roga / Incense Stick Disease),"Before sowing, soak seeds in hot water at 52°C for 10 minutes to kill hidden fungus inside seeds. In the field, if you notice stick-like structures instead of grains, pull out those plants immediately. Burn them away from the field. Never leave infected plants inside the field, as this disease spreads through seed and soil."
Paddy,Grain Discoloration (Golu Roga / Dirty Panicle),"Control insects like Gundhi Bug using neem oil spray, as their bite allows fungus to enter grains. After harvest, dry the grains properly under sunlight until moisture is below 14%. Well-dried grains store better and do not rot. Avoid harvesting during wet weather and store grains in clean, dry bags to prevent discoloration."
Paddy,Kernel Smut (Kari Gantu / Black Smut),"Avoid excess fertilizer, especially nitrogen, during flowering. Too much fertilizer increases disease risk. Spray Propiconazole (Tilt) at the boot stage to prevent infection. Always use clean, healthy seeds for sowing. Never save seeds from infected fields for the next season, as this disease spreads mainly through contaminated seeds."
Paddy,Grain Rot (Sada Roga / Bacterial Panicle Blight),"Do not allow water to stagnate in the field during flowering; ensure proper drainage. If grains turn straw-colored or brown and fail to fill, spray Streptocycline 6 g mixed in 60 liters of water. Maintain field cleanliness and avoid late evening irrigation. Balanced fertilizer use and good airflow reduce disease chances."
Paddy,Sheath Rot (Soolai Noi / Chaffy Grains),"When the grain head is still inside the leaf (booting stage), spray Carbendazim + Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter of water to stop the rot early. Control pests like stem borers and mites because their damage allows the disease to enter. Apply extra potash fertilizer, which helps the plant push the grain head out properly and reduces grain emptiness."
Paddy,Bacterial Grain Rot (Pal Karal / Grain Blight),"Do not allow water from an infected field to flow into a healthy field, as the disease spreads through water. Spray a mixture of Streptocycline @ 0.1 g/L and Copper Oxychloride @ 2 g/L. For a natural method, spray filtered cow dung extract or neem oil, which forms a protective layer on grains and reduces infection."
Paddy,Brown Spot – Grain Stage (Karum Pulli / Sesame Spot),"This disease mainly attacks weak crops, so improve soil health by applying zinc and silicon. During the milk-filling stage, spray Mancozeb @ 2 g/L or Propiconazole. Before sowing, treat seeds in hot water at 54°C for 10 minutes to kill disease-causing fungus and ensure healthy plant growth from the start."
Paddy,Red Stripe (Sivappu Pattai),"Maintain wider plant spacing to allow air movement and reduce moisture around plants. Follow intermittent drainage, allowing the field to dry for two days before re-flooding. Reduce excess urea fertilizer, as too much nitrogen increases disease. Keep the soil moist but not waterlogged during grain formation for better disease control."
Paddy,Bakanae Disease (Foolish Seedling / Manja Roga),"This disease starts from infected seeds and causes tall, weak plants with empty grains. Always treat seeds with Tricyclazole before sowing. In the field, if you see abnormally tall, thin, pale plants, remove them immediately and destroy them. Early removal prevents the disease from spreading to healthy plants and grain heads."
Paddy,Paddy Bunt (Kernel Smut / Tilletia),"This disease spreads mainly through infected seeds. To prevent it, spray Propiconazole at the boot stage, before the grain head fully comes out. After harvest, remove black-colored bunted grains during cleaning and processing. Never use infected grains for next season sowing. Clean seed selection and timely spray help reduce yield loss and stop future spread."
Paddy,Bacterial Panicle Blight (Grain Rot / Burkholderia),"Always use certified, disease-free seeds to avoid early infection. During flowering, avoid stagnant water and drain the field to reduce humidity. If symptoms like empty or brown grains appear, spray Streptocycline 6 g mixed in 60 liters of water. Good water management and clean seeds are the best protection against this disease."
Paddy,Glume Blight (Phoma / Dirty Glumes),"Apply potash fertilizer to strengthen the grain covering and improve resistance. When grains are in the milky stage, spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter. Avoid excessive moisture in the field and ensure good air circulation. Balanced nutrition and timely spraying help keep grains clean and market-ready."
Paddy,Stem Rot – Grain Stage (Kanda Kuhl),"Before planting, apply neem cake to the soil to reduce fungus buildup. If stems start weakening or rotting during grain stage, spray Hexaconazole @ 2 ml per liter, focusing on the base of the plant and panicles. Avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer and maintain proper drainage to stop disease spread and lodging."
Paddy,Panicle Blast (Gardan Tod / Neck Blast),"Once the panicle starts emerging, stop applying urea, as too much nitrogen increases blast damage. Spray Tricyclazole @ 0.6 g per liter of water at early symptom stage. This protects the neck of the panicle from breaking. Timely spray and balanced fertilizer use are very important to save yield."
Peach,Brown Rot,"This is the most destructive disease where the fruit turns soft, brown, and gets covered in tufts of grey powdery fungus. The whole fruit rots quickly and may dry up (mummify) on the tree. To control this, you must remove and burn all dried ""mummy"" fruits remaining on the tree during winter. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter during the pink bud stage and again 2-3 weeks before harvest to protect the ripening fruit."
Peach,Peach Scab (Black Spot),"Small, round, velvet-black spots (freckles) appear on the fruit skin, mostly near the stem. In severe cases, these spots merge, forming large black patches that cause the fruit skin to crack. Prune the tree to open the center so sunlight reaches all fruits, as this fungus loves shade. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Captan @ 2 grams per liter starting two weeks after petals fall. Repeat every 10-14 days until the fruit is half-grown."
Peach,Bacterial Spot (Bacteriosis),"Small, angular, purple-black spots appear on the fruit, causing deep pits or cracks. Sticky gum often oozes out from these wounds. This is very hard to cure once it starts. The best solution is to plant resistant varieties. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Oxytetracycline during the early growing season, but be careful as Copper can burn peach leaves; use it only when recommended for your area."
Peach,Rhizopus Rot (Leak / Soft Rot),"This rot attacks ripe fruits during harvest or storage. The fruit turns very soft, watery, and leaks liquid. It gets covered in a fluffy white mold with tiny black dots. This fungus enters only through cuts and bruises. Handle peaches like eggs during harvest; do not drop or squeeze them. Cool the fruits immediately after picking. Clean the packing crates with bleach solution."
Peach,Anthracnose,"Circular, sunken brown spots appear on the fruit skin. In wet weather, you might see sticky, salmon-pink colored spores in the center of the spots. The fruit eventually rots. Remove wild plum or neglected fruit trees near your orchard as they carry this fungus. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Propiconazole @ 1 ml per liter during the fruit development stage, especially if the weather is warm and rainy."
Peach,Powdery Mildew (Rusty Spot),"White, powdery patches appear on young fruits. As the fruit grows, these spots turn into hard, russeted (rusty-brown) patches or net-like patterns on the skin. The fruit does not rot but looks bad and sells for less. Prune the tree to reduce humidity. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Myclobutanil @ 0.5 ml per liter when the fruit shucks (coverings) start splitting off."
Peach,Plum Curculio (Worm Damage),"A small beetle cuts a crescent-shaped (half-moon) mark on the fruit skin to lay eggs. The grub (worm) eats inside, causing the fruit to rot and drop early. Collect and destroy all dropped fruits immediately to kill the larvae inside. Spray Imidacloprid @ 0.5 ml per liter or Phosmet @ 1.5 grams per liter just after the petals fall to kill the adults before they lay eggs."
Peach,Oriental Fruit Moth,"The larvae bore into the fruit near the stem, feeding around the pit (stone). The entry hole is often filled with gummy waste. The fruit ripens too fast and rots. Use pheromone mating disruption ties in the orchard to confuse male moths. Spray Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter or Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter if you see shoot wilting or fruit damage beginning in early summer."
Pear,Pear Scab,"This fungus causes dark, velvety, olive-green spots on the fruit, which later become black, corky, and rough (scabby). The fruit often cracks and becomes deformed. To control this, collect and burn all fallen leaves and fruits in autumn as the fungus hides there during winter. Prune the tree to open up the canopy for sunlight. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter when the buds are just opening and again when small fruits are forming."
Pear,Fire Blight,"This is a dangerous bacterial disease where the young fruits turn black, shrivel, and dry up but stay hanging on the tree, looking like they were burned by fire. Usually, liquid oozes from the infected parts. Cut the infected branches 12 inches below the visible damage using shears dipped in bleach solution between every cut. Spray Streptocycline (0.5 gram) mixed with Copper Oxychloride (2 grams) per liter of water during the flowering stage to protect the young fruits."
Pear,Bitter Rot,"Small, brown, circular spots appear on the fruit, which enlarge and sink into the flesh. In humid weather, pinkish spores appear in the center of the spots. The fruit tastes bitter and rots. Remove all ""mummy"" (dried) fruits hanging on the tree. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Thiophanate Methyl @ 1 gram per liter during the summer when fruits are growing. Ensure good drainage in the orchard."
Pear,Fabraea Fruit Spot (Black Spot),"Small, purple-black spots appear on the fruit skin. As the fruit grows, the spots become sunken, and the fruit may crack or drop early. This happens mostly in wet seasons. Rake up and destroy fallen leaves and fruits. Spray Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter starting from petal fall. Repeat the spray every 10-15 days if the rain continues."
Pear,Stony Pit (Viral Disease),"The fruit becomes extremely bumpy, pitted, and deformed. The flesh inside becomes hard and woody (stone-like) and is difficult to cut. This is a virus and cannot be cured by spraying chemicals. The only solution is to remove the infected tree so it does not infect others. Always use virus-free grafted plants from a certified nursery when planting new trees."
Pear,Sooty Blotch and Flyspeck,"These are two different fungi that often appear together. Sooty blotch looks like black smudges on the skin, and flyspeck looks like tiny black dots (fly poop). It is a cosmetic issue and does not rot the fruit inside. Prune the tree to allow air circulation and reduce humidity around the fruits. Spraying Zineb or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter during the late summer rains will easily clean up the skin."
Pear,Blue Mold (Soft Rot),"This is the most common rot during storage. The fruit develops a soft, watery spot that quickly gets covered in blue-green powdery mold. It has a musty smell. Handle pears very gently during harvest to avoid punctures or bruises, as the mold enters through wounds. Dip harvested fruits in a solution of Thiabendazole before storage. Keep the storage area cool and clean."
Pear,Codling Moth (Worm in Fruit),"The larva bores into the fruit and eats the seeds, pushing out brown waste (frass) through the entry hole. The fruit ripens early and falls. Scrape loose bark from the tree trunk where larvae hide during winter. Hang Pheromone traps to catch male moths. Spray Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter or Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter after petal fall to kill the young worms before they enter the fruit."
Pear,Pear Psylla Damage,"These tiny insects suck sap and produce sticky ""honeydew"" on the fruit, which turns into black Sooty Mold. The fruit skin may become russeted (rough and brown). Wash the trees with a strong jet of water to remove the sticky honeydew. Spray Imidacloprid @ 0.5 ml per liter or use Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter to control the insects. Controlling the insect stops the black mold problem."
Pineapple,Heart Rot / Soft Rot,"The base of the fruit or the center heart becomes soft, watery, and smells bad. The fruit rots and pulls out easily. To prevent this, dip the suckers (seeds) in a solution of Mancozeb (2 grams per liter) or Metalaxyl (1 gram per liter) before planting. Improve drainage in the field so water does not stand. If disease appears, spray Fosetyl-Al @ 2 grams per liter on the plants."
Pineapple,Fruitlet Core Rot (Black Spot),"The outside of the fruit looks normal, but when you cut it, the eyes inside are black or brown and hard. This is caused by fungi entering through flower parts or mite damage. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter during the flowering stage. Since mites help spread this, spray a miticide like Dicofol @ 2 ml per liter if you see insects."
Pineapple,Yeasty Fermentation (Water Blister),"The fruit skin cracks or gets injured, and the inside turns soft, bubbly, and smells like alcohol or vinegar. This happens due to yeast entering wounds. Handle fruits very gently during harvest and transport to avoid cracks. Do not leave harvested fruits in the hot sun; cool them immediately. Dip the cut stem end in a solution of Benomyl or Thiabendazole immediately after harvest."
Pineapple,Sunburn (Sun Scald),"The side of the fruit facing the sun turns yellow-white or bleached and becomes soft or dried out. The flesh inside loses flavor. Cover the developing fruits with dry grass, straw, or push the plant's own leaves over the fruit to shade it. Planting trees closer together can also provide natural shade for the fruits."
Pineapple,Pink Disease,"The fruit looks fine from the outside, but when heated for canning or cooking, the flesh turns brownish-pink and smells bad. This is caused by bacteria. To prevent this, harvest the fruit early before it becomes over-ripe. Avoid harvesting during heavy rain. Ensure the field has good drainage and apply balanced fertilizers to keep the plant strong."
Pineapple,Marbling Disease,"The flesh inside the fruit becomes hard, speckled with brown spots, and very crisp (crunchy). It is a bacterial disease. Clean the harvesting knives with bleach solution frequently to stop spreading it from plant to plant. Control fruit borers and other insects as they carry the bacteria into the fruit. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during fruit development."
Pineapple,Green Fruit Rot,"Green fruits rotting on the plant, often starting near the soil. This happens in very wet soil. Avoid planting in low-lying areas where water collects. Do not throw soil onto the plant during weeding operations. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter if heavy rains occur while fruits are still green."
Pineapple,Leathery Pocket,The internal flesh becomes hard and corky (leathery) in pockets. This is not a fungus but a reaction to insects or stress. Regular watering is key. Control insects like mites and mealybugs using Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter or appropriate insecticides during the early growth of the fruit to prevent this internal damage.
Plum,Brown Rot,"This is the most damaging disease where the fruit turns soft, watery brown, and gets covered in grey powdery tufts. The fruit rots quickly and often shrivels up (mummies) on the tree. To control this, remove and burn all dried ""mummy"" fruits remaining on the tree during winter. Spray Captan @ 2 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter when the flowers start opening and again 2 weeks before harvest."
Plum,Plum Pockets (Bladder Plum),"The fruit becomes unusually large, puffed up, and hollow like a balloon. It turns pale yellow or grey and eventually dries up and falls. This fungus overwinters on the twigs. Remove and destroy all deformed, puffed-up fruits immediately. The most important treatment is to spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Lime Sulphur just before the buds open in early spring (dormant stage) to kill the fungus before it enters the flower."
Plum,Bacterial Spot (Shot Hole),"Dark, sunken, scabby spots appear on the fruit skin, often causing deep cracks or pits. The fruit may drop early. This disease spreads in warm, wet weather. Avoid planting in low-lying areas with poor air circulation. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter very carefully (as it can burn leaves) or use Agrimycin (Streptocycline) during the petal fall stage. Using resistant varieties is the best long-term solution."
Plum,Plum Scab,"Small, round, olive-green velvety spots appear on the fruit skin. As the fruit grows, these spots turn black and may cause the skin to crack. It usually happens if the orchard is too shady or damp. Prune the tree to allow sunlight to reach the inner branches. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Captan @ 2 grams per liter when the fruit shucks (coverings) are splitting off the young fruit."
Plum,Plum Pox Virus (Sharka),"Pale rings or yellow patterns appear on the fruit skin. The fruit may become deformed, bumpy, and drop prematurely. The flesh inside often has brown streaks. There is no chemical cure for this virus. You must dig out and burn the infected tree immediately to save the rest of the orchard. Control aphids (greenflies) by spraying Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter, as they spread this virus from tree to tree."
Plum,Plum Curculio Damage,"A small beetle cuts a crescent-shaped (half-moon) mark on the fruit skin to lay eggs. The worm eats inside, causing the fruit to rot and drop. Collect and bury all fallen fruits daily to kill the larvae inside. Spray Imidacloprid @ 0.5 ml per liter or Phosmet @ 1.5 grams per liter immediately after the petals fall to kill the adults before they damage the fruit."
Plum,Rhizopus Rot (Ripe Fruit Rot),"This rot attacks ripe fruits during harvest or storage. The fruit turns very soft, leaks liquid, and gets covered in a fluffy white mold with black dots. It enters only through wounds. Handle plums very gently during harvest; do not drop or squeeze them. Cool the fruits immediately after picking. Dip the fruits in a solution of Propiconazole or recommended post-harvest fungicide before packing."
Plum,Russeting (Powdery Mildew),"White powdery patches on young fruits eventually disappear, leaving behind hard, brown, rough (rusty) patches on the skin. The fruit does not rot but looks ugly. Prune the tree to reduce humidity. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 grams per liter or Myclobutanil @ 0.5 ml per liter starting from the petal fall stage to keep the skin smooth."
Pomegranate,Bacterial Blight (Oily Spot / Telya),"This is the most dangerous disease where oily spots appear on the fruit and later crack open. Immediately cut and burn all infected branches and fruits to stop the spread. After pruning, apply Bordeaux paste on cut ends. Spray a mixture of Streptocycline (0.5 gram) and Copper Oxychloride (2.5 grams) per liter of water. During the rainy season, repeat the spray every 10-15 days and keep the orchard floor very clean."
Pomegranate,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"Small, dark brown spots appear on the fruit skin, which later become hard and sunken. Prune and destroy dried twigs and infected fruits. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Propiconazole @ 1 ml per liter during the fruit development stage. If the weather is cloudy and humid, spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter to protect the healthy fruits."
Pomegranate,Heart Rot (Internal Breakdown),"The fruit looks healthy from the outside, but the inside turns black and rotten with a foul smell. This fungus enters through the flower. To prevent this, spray Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter during the flowering stage. Ensure the tree gets enough Boron and Calcium so the flower end does not crack and let the fungus in."
Pomegranate,Fruit Cracking (Splitting),"Fruits crack open, usually due to irregular watering or Boron deficiency. Maintain constant soil moisture by watering regularly; do not let the soil get too dry and then flood it. Spray Borax or Solubor @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are lemon-sized. Mulching the soil with dry grass helps keep moisture levels steady and prevents cracking."
Pomegranate,Sun Scald (Sunburn),"A black or white hard patch forms on the side of the fruit facing the sun, damaging the quality. Protect the developing fruits by covering them with paper bags or dry grass. Maintain a good leaf canopy by providing balanced nutrition so the leaves naturally shade the fruits. In extreme heat, spray Kaolin clay (50 grams per liter) to create a white protective layer on the fruits."
Pomegranate,Fruit Borer (Anar Butterfly),"The butterfly lays eggs on the flower/fruit, and the caterpillar bores inside, causing rot and bad smell. Cover the fruits with butter paper bags or polymer bags when they are the size of a lemon. Remove and destroy any fruits with holes immediately. Spray Neem Oil @ 3 ml per liter or Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter when the fruits are small to keep the pest away."
Pomegranate,Cercospora Fruit Spot,"Black necrotic spots cover the fruit surface, reducing its market value. This usually happens in warm, humid weather. Clean the orchard by removing weeds and fallen leaves. Spray Thiophanate Methyl @ 1 gram per liter or Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter. Repeat the spray after 15 days if the spots continue to appear."
Pomegranate,Alternaria Fruit Spot,"Small reddish-brown spots appear, often starting near the crown (calyx) of the fruit, eventually causing rot. Spray Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter or Tebuconazole @ 1 ml per liter during fruit development. Improve air circulation in the orchard by pruning extra branches so humidity does not build up around the fruits."
Sapota,Anthracnose (Fruit Rot),"This disease causes dark, sunken spots on the fruit, which eventually harden or rot. To control it, prune the tree to remove dead twigs and overcrowded branches. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Mancozeb @ 2 grams per liter when the fruits are setting. Ensure the orchard is clean and destroy any fallen, rotting fruits immediately to prevent the fungus from spreading to healthy trees."
Sapota,Sooty Mold (Black Coating),"A black, powdery layer covers the fruit, reducing its market price. This is caused by sticky honeydew from insects like scale insects and mealybugs. To fix this, spray a Starch solution (boil 1 kg Maida in 5 liters of water, cool, and dilute in 20 liters) on the fruits; as it dries, the mold peels off. You must also control the insects by spraying Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter or Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter."
Sapota,Fasciation (Flat Limb / Bandha Disease),"The branches become flat and twisted, and the fruits produced on them are tiny, clustered, and useless. This is a viral or genetic disorder. The only effective treatment is to cut and remove the flattened branches immediately and apply Bordeaux paste on the cut ends. Do not use grafts or bud sticks from trees that have this problem. Maintain good nutrition to keep the tree strong."
Sapota,Fruit Drop (Physiological),"Many young fruits turn yellow and drop off before maturing due to temperature changes or water stress. To stop this, spray NAA (Planofix) @ 4 ml in 18 liters of water twice: once during flowering and again when fruits are pea-sized. Alternatively, spray Gibberellic Acid (GA3) @ 50 ppm. Ensure regular watering during the summer months to keep the soil moisture constant."
Sapota,Chikoo Moth / Fruit Borer,"The larvae bore into flower buds and young fruits, causing them to dry up and fall with a hole visible. Clean the orchard floor by removing fallen buds and fruits. Install light traps to catch the moths. Spray Quinalphos @ 2 ml per liter or Profenofos @ 1 ml per liter during the bud and flowering stage. Avoid spraying chemicals when the fruit is close to harvest."
Sapota,Seed Borer,"This is a serious pest where a tiny worm enters the fruit and eats the seed inside, making the fruit rot from within. The entry hole heals, so the fruit looks fine outside but is bad inside. Collect and burn all fallen fruits. Spray Deltamethrin @ 1 ml per liter or Neem Oil @ 5 ml per liter when fruits are marble-sized to prevent the pest from entering."
Sapota,Fruit Spot (Phaeophleospora),"Small, pinkish to reddish-brown spots appear on the fruit skin, which may join together to form large patches. Prune the canopy to allow sunlight to reach the inner branches. Spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Thiophanate Methyl @ 1 gram per liter during fruit development. Repeat the spray after 20 days if the weather remains humid."
Strawberry,Grey Mold (Botrytis Rot),"This disease spreads in cool, humid weather and thick crop growth. Keep good air movement by avoiding overcrowding and removing infected fruits and old leaves. Do not irrigate late in the evening. If needed, spray Carbendazim or Hexaconazole @ 1 g per liter of water. Harvest fruits on time and keep them dry during storage to reduce mold development."
Strawberry,Leather Rot (Phytophthora Rot),"This disease occurs when fruits touch wet soil. Use mulching with straw or plastic to keep fruits off the ground. Improve drainage and avoid water stagnation. Spray Metalaxyl + Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter after heavy rains. Remove and destroy infected fruits immediately, as they give bitter taste and spread infection in the field."
Strawberry,Anthracnose (Ripe Fruit Rot),"Collect and destroy infected fruits regularly to stop spread. Avoid overhead irrigation, especially during flowering and fruiting. Spray Carbendazim or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter at early fruit stage and repeat if needed. Keep the field clean and rotate crops every season to reduce fungus buildup in soil."
Strawberry,Powdery Mildew (Fruit Mildew),This disease looks like white powder on fruits and leaves and spreads in dry weather. Spray Wettable Sulphur @ 2 g per liter or Hexaconazole @ 1 ml per liter. Remove heavily infected plant parts. Ensure proper spacing between plants for air movement. Balanced fertilizer use helps fruits ripen properly and reduces disease severity.
Strawberry,Rhizopus Rot (Soft Rot / Leak),This disease mainly spreads after harvest through wounds on fruits. Handle fruits carefully during harvesting and transport to avoid injuries. Remove damaged fruits immediately. Keep storage areas clean and dry. Dip harvested fruits in hot water (48–50°C for 2–3 minutes) or spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter to reduce rot during storage.
Strawberry,Stem-End Rot (Gnomonia),"This rot starts near the fruit cap, so always harvest fruits carefully without pulling the green cap. Remove and destroy infected fruits from the field. Avoid overhead watering during fruiting and keep good air circulation. Spray Carbendazim or Thiophanate-methyl @ 1 g per liter at early fruit stage. Clean field sanitation and timely harvest greatly reduce this disease."
Strawberry,Black Spot (Alternaria),"Collect and destroy infected fruits and fallen plant waste regularly. Avoid water splashing on fruits during irrigation. Spray Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter or Chlorothalonil at fruit development stage. Maintain proper plant spacing and apply balanced fertilizer, especially potassium. Good air flow and clean field conditions help prevent further spread and keep fruits market-ready."
Strawberry,Fruit Blotch (Pestalotiopsis),This disease spreads during humid weather. Remove affected fruits immediately to stop spread. Avoid dense planting and improve air circulation. Spray Carbendazim or Propiconazole @ 1 g per liter at early symptom stage. Use clean planting material and avoid wetting fruits while watering. Proper drainage and timely spray help fruits remain healthy and smooth.
Strawberry,Soft Water Rot (Mucor Rot),"This rot develops very fast after harvest, especially on injured fruits. Harvest carefully to avoid cuts and bruises. Remove damaged fruits immediately. Keep harvested fruits in a cool, dry place. Dip fruits in hot water at 48–50°C for 2–3 minutes or spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter to reduce post-harvest losses."
Strawberry,Berry Soft Rot (Choanephora Rot),"This disease spreads very fast in hot, humid weather. Remove and destroy infected fruits immediately to stop spread. Avoid overcrowding and ensure good air flow between plants. Do not irrigate late evening. Spray Carbendazim or Mancozeb @ 2 g per liter at early symptoms. Keep the field clean and well-drained to reduce humidity and fungal growth."
Strawberry,Sunscald (Physiological Disorder – Not a Disease),"Sunscald happens due to strong sunlight, not germs. Protect fruits by maintaining good leaf cover; avoid excessive pruning. Use straw mulch or shade nets to reduce heat stress. Water the field regularly to avoid moisture stress. Balanced fertilizer application helps plants maintain healthy foliage, which naturally shields fruits from direct sun damage."
Strawberry,Fruit Mummy (Monilinia Rot),"Collect and destroy mummified fruits from plants and soil, as they spread infection next season. Improve air circulation by proper spacing and pruning. Avoid water splash on fruits. Spray Carbendazim or Propiconazole @ 1 g per liter during flowering and early fruit stage. Good field sanitation is the most effective control method for this disease."
Strawberry,Secondary Rots (Penicillium / Aspergillus),"These rots enter through wounds caused by birds, cracks, or rough handling. Control birds using nets and harvest fruits carefully. Remove damaged fruits immediately. Keep storage rooms clean, cool, and dry. Dip fruits in hot water (48–50°C for 2–3 minutes) or spray Carbendazim @ 1 g per liter to reduce post-harvest losses."
Tomato,Blossom End Rot (Nutrient Problem),This is not a disease. It happens due to lack of calcium and irregular watering. Water the crop regularly and do not allow soil to dry fully or stay flooded. Put mulch like dry leaves or straw to keep moisture. Spray calcium chloride or calcium nitrate on small fruits to help them grow strong and healthy.
Tomato,Tomato Fruit Borer (Insect),This is very common in Karnataka. The worm enters the fruit and eats from inside. Remove and destroy damaged fruits immediately. Use pheromone traps to catch moths early. Grow marigold plants around the field to reduce attack. Spray neem-based spray or biopesticides in the early stage to control worms.
Tomato,Pinworm – Tuta absoluta (Insect),This pest makes tiny holes and damages fruit from inside. Install Tuta pheromone traps and light traps in the field. Remove and burn affected fruits quickly. Do not leave damaged fruits in the field. Rotate crops next season to reduce this pest problem.
Tomato,Anthracnose (Fungal Disease),"Small black or brown sunken spots appear on ripe fruits, especially during rainy weather. Keep fruits off the soil by tying plants to sticks. Harvest fruits as soon as they ripen. Keep the field clean. If rain continues, spray copper-based fungicide to protect fruits."
Tomato,Early Blight (Fungal Disease),Dark ring-like spots appear first on old leaves and later on fruits. Remove yellow and infected lower leaves. Give enough space between plants for air movement. Spray Mancozeb or similar fungicide when early symptoms appear on leaves.
Tomato,Buckeye Rot (Fungal Disease),Fruits touching wet soil develop round brown spots. Always keep fruits above ground using stakes. Apply straw or plastic mulch to avoid soil contact. Improve drainage and avoid water standing in the field. Raised beds help prevent this problem.
Tomato,Bacterial Spot (Bacterial Disease),Fruits develop rough brown spots that reduce market value. Avoid sprinkling water on leaves and fruits. Use drip irrigation. Remove affected fruits. Spray copper-based bactericide early to stop further spread during rainy weather.
Tomato,Tomato Spotted Wilt (Bud Necrosis),This virus is common in South India. Infected plants cannot be cured. Remove and destroy the whole plant immediately. Control thrips by fixing blue sticky traps in the field. Spray Neem Oil regularly or Imidacloprid in early stages. Keep the field and borders free from weeds where thrips hide.
Tomato,Late Blight,"This disease appears during cool, cloudy, or misty weather. Spray Mancozeb or Metalaxyl before or at the first sign of disease. Keep enough space between plants so air can flow and leaves dry fast. Avoid watering on leaves, especially in the evening."
Tomato,Bacterial Canker,"Once a plant is infected, it cannot be cured. Remove and destroy infected plants to protect others. Spray copper-based chemicals on healthy plants to reduce spread. Clean knives and tools after use. Always use certified disease-free seeds for the next crop."
Tomato,Sunscald,"This is sunburn, not a disease. It happens in hot weather when fruits are exposed to direct sunlight. Do not remove too many leaves. Allow leaves to shade fruits naturally. During extreme heat, use a light shade net (30%) to protect fruits."
Tomato,Fruit Cracking,This happens due to sudden heavy watering after dry conditions. Water the crop regularly and evenly. Use mulch to maintain soil moisture. Avoid excess irrigation after rain. Choose crack-resistant varieties if possible. Remove cracked fruits early to avoid rotting.
Tomato,Catfacing (Physiological Problem),"Fruits become misshapen and scarred, especially in cold North Indian winters. This is not a disease. Avoid planting sensitive varieties during very cold months. Do not apply excess nitrogen fertilizer. Proper planting time is the best solution; sprays will not help."
Tomato,Puffiness / Hollow Fruit (Physiological Problem),Fruits look normal but feel light and empty inside. This happens due to poor pollination during very hot or very cold weather. Gently shake plants during daytime to help pollen movement. Avoid spraying chemicals during flowering as they reduce bee activity.
Tomato,Grey Mold (Ghost Spot) – Fungal,"Small white rings appear on fruits in cool and damp weather. Reduce humidity by removing excess leaves so air can pass through plants. In protected cultivation, keep good ventilation. Remove affected fruits. Spray Chlorothalonil only if wet weather continues."
Tomato,Black Mold (Fungal),"Ripe fruits develop black powdery mold, mainly after rain near harvest. Harvest fruits as soon as they ripen. Avoid fruit cracking and sunburn. Handle fruits carefully during picking so the skin is not damaged."
Tomato,Cloudy Spot (Insect Damage),"White or yellow cloudy patches appear on fruit skin, and taste becomes poor. This is caused by stink bugs sucking fruit juice. Keep the field and borders free of weeds. Handpick bugs using gloves. Spray Neem Oil to stop bugs from feeding."
Walnut,Walnut Blight (Bacterial),"This is the most dangerous disease. Small, water-soaked spots appear on the green husk, which quickly turn black and sunken. The nut inside shrivels, turns black, and rots. To control it, spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter or Bordeaux Mixture (1%) starting when the female flowers (catkins) appear. Repeat the spray every 7-10 days if the weather is wet during spring. Avoid overhead sprinklers as water splashing spreads the bacteria."
Walnut,Anthracnose,"Circular, sunken, brown spots appear on the green husk. If the infection is severe, the nut drops early or the kernel inside shrivels. The shell may get stained dark. Clean the orchard by burning fallen leaves and nuts in winter, as the fungus lives there. Spray Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter or Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter when the leaves are unfolding and again when the nuts are small."
Walnut,Codling Moth Damage,"The larva (worm) bores into the young nut through the blossom end, eating the kernel inside. You will see black waste (frass) at the entry hole. The damaged nuts fall early. Use pheromone traps to catch male moths. Spray Spinosad @ 0.3 ml per liter or Carbaryl @ 2 grams per liter when the moths are flying (usually late spring). Remove and destroy all fallen, infested nuts immediately."
Walnut,Walnut Husk Fly,"Maggots feed inside the green husk, turning it into a black, soft, mushy liquid. This stains the nut shell a dirty black color and makes the kernel shrivel. Hang yellow sticky traps to catch the flies. Spray a bait mixture (Jaggery/Molasses + Malathion) on the leaves to attract and kill the flies before they lay eggs. This does not damage the nut directly but ruins the quality and price."
Walnut,Kernel Mold,"The nut looks fine outside, but when cracked, the kernel is covered in green, blue, or black mold. This happens if the hull splits but the nut is not harvested quickly, or if insects damage the shell. Harvest the nuts as soon as 80% of the hulls have split; do not leave them on the tree. Dry the harvested nuts immediately to remove moisture. Controlling sunburn and insect damage also prevents mold."
Walnut,Sunburn,"The side of the green husk facing the hot sun turns yellow or brown and becomes hard. The kernel inside may darken or shrivel. This happens in peak summer. Maintain a healthy canopy of leaves to shade the nuts by providing enough water and fertilizer. In extreme heat, you can whitewash the tree trunks or use overhead misters to cool the orchard, but avoid keeping the nuts wet for too long."
Walnut,Branch Wilt (Nuts drying),"While this affects branches, the main symptom farmers see is the husk and nut drying up suddenly and sticking to the branch (mummies). The outer husk turns greyish-brown. Prune the affected branch well below the wilted part and burn it. Do not shake the tree when harvesting infected nuts, as this spreads fungal spores. Maintain tree health with proper irrigation."
Watermelon,Anthracnose (Round Spot),"Sunken, circular spots appear on the fruit rind, which turn black during rain, causing the fruit to crack or rot. Clean the field by destroying infected vines and fruits and do not plant watermelon in the same place every year. Spray Carbendazim @ 1 gram per liter or Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter when fruits start forming. Handle fruits carefully to avoid skin damage during harvest."
Watermelon,Bacterial Fruit Blotch,"Dark, water-soaked, oily stains appear on the top surface of the fruit, eventually causing the skin to crack and the fruit to rot inside. This spreads fast in warm, wet weather. Use only certified disease-free seeds. If you see symptoms, spray Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter mixed with Streptocycline (small packet) immediately. Avoid overhead watering (sprinklers) as it splashes bacteria onto the fruit."
Watermelon,Blossom End Rot,"The bottom end of the fruit (where the flower was) turns black, leathery, and flat. This is not a fungus but a result of Calcium deficiency and irregular watering. Maintain steady soil moisture by watering regularly; do not let the soil get too dry and then flood it. Spray Calcium Chloride or Calcium Nitrate @ 2 grams per liter when fruits are small (marble-sized) to fix the deficiency."
Watermelon,Belly Rot (Ground Rot),"The part of the fruit touching the wet soil turns brown, soft, and develops mold. To prevent this, do not let fruits sit directly on the soil. Place a piece of wood, stone, or a bed of dry straw (mulch) under each fruit. You can also use plastic mulch sheets before planting. Spraying the soil under the vines with Copper Oxychloride @ 3 grams per liter can help reduce the fungus."
Watermelon,Sun Scald (Sunburn),"Large white or bleached patches appear on the fruit surface exposed to direct sunlight, making the area weak and prone to rot. Maintain a healthy leaf canopy to shade the fruits by providing proper fertilizers. Cover exposed fruits with dry straw, newspaper caps, or the plant's own leaves during the peak summer heat to protect the skin."
Watermelon,Gummy Stem Blight (Black Rot),"While this attacks stems, it also causes black, wrinkled rot on the fruit, often with gummy oozing. It usually enters through wounds. Clean up crop debris after harvest. Spray Chlorothalonil @ 2 grams per liter or Mancozeb @ 2.5 grams per liter. Ensure good air circulation in the field and avoid injuring the fruit during weeding or turning."
Watermelon,Watermelon Mosaic Virus,"The fruit becomes bumpy, mottled (mixed colors), and deformed, making it hard to sell. This is spread by aphids (greenflies). Remove and destroy weeds around the field where aphids hide. Pull out and bury infected plants immediately. Spray Imidacloprid @ 0.5 ml per liter or Dimethoate @ 2 ml per liter to control the aphids and stop the spread."
Watermelon,Fusarium Fruit Rot,"The fruit develops soft spots that may turn into white or pink moldy patches, often starting at the stem end. Use resistant varieties if available. Dip the fruit in hot water (55°C) for 2 minutes after harvest to clean the skin. Avoid pulling the fruit from the vine; always cut it with a clipper to leave a smooth stem, preventing the fungus from entering."
