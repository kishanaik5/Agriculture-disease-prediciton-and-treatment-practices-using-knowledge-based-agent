Vegetable Common Name ,Disease Name (Type),Treatment Methods
Agathi,Rust (Fungal),Brown or reddish pustules appear on the undersides of leaves. Treatment: Agathi leaves are often eaten as greens or fodder. Avoid systemic fungicides. Prune the infected branches. Spray diluted Sulphur or Neem oil. Ensure the tree gets full sun.
Agathi,Leaf Eating Caterpillar (Insect),"Green caterpillars eat the leaves and tunnel into the flower buds, ruining the edible flowers. Treatment: Since the flowers are eaten directly, avoid harsh chemicals. Handpick the caterpillars. Shake the tree gently to drop them. Spray a diluted Neem oil solution (2ml per liter) if the infestation is severe."
Agathi,Stem Borer (Insect Larvae),"Larvae bore into the stem, causing wilting. Treatment: Inject neem oil into the bore hole and seal with clay."
Agathi,Leaf/Flower Webber (Insect Larvae),"Caterpillars spin webs around the leaves and flowers (the edible part) and eat them from inside. Treatment: Since flowers are delicate, handpick the caterpillars or shake the tree gently to dislodge them. Spray a dilute neem oil solution. Encourage birds in the garden."
Agathi,Powdery Mildew (Fungal Infection),"A white powdery coating appears on the leaves and pods, causing them to dry up and drop early. This is common in dry, cool weather. Prune the tree to improve sunlight penetration. Spray wettable sulfur (2g/liter) or a biological control like Ampelomyces quisqualis. If harvesting for food, a baking soda spray (1 tsp + 1 liter water) is a safe, non-toxic alternative."
Agathi,Leaf Spot (Fungal Infection),"Brown or black circular spots appear on the edible leaves, rendering them unappealing. Remove heavily infected leaves to stop the spread. Improve air circulation by thinning branches. If severe, spray a copper-based fungicide, but observe a strict waiting period (7-10 days) before harvesting leaves for consumption. Avoid overhead watering in the evening."
Agathi,Pod Borer (Insect Infestation),Larvae bore into the long pods and eat the developing seeds. Look for small holes and frass. Manually remove infested pods. Install light traps to catch adult moths. Spray Neem oil or Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) during the flowering and pod-formation stage. Regular harvesting of mature pods prevents the population from building up.
Agathi,Stem Borer (Insect Infestation),"Though primarily in the stem, severe infestation cuts off nutrients, causing the edible leaves and flowers to wilt and yellow. Look for sawdust at the base. Inject a Neem oil solution into the bore holes and seal with clay. Maintain tree vigor with organic compost; healthy trees resist borers better."
Agathi,Mosaic Virus (Viral Infection),Leaves show mottled yellow and green patterns and may become deformed. There is no cure. Remove and burn the infected branches or the whole tree if young. Control aphids and whiteflies which spread the virus using sticky traps or insecticidal soap.
Agathi ,Leaf Webber (Insect Infestation),"The larvae weave the tender leaves and flower buds together with silk and feed from inside. Since Agathi leaves are often eaten raw or lightly cooked, avoid harsh chemicals. Handpick the webbed clusters and destroy them. Spray an aqueous extract of Neem kernel or a simple soap solution. Encourage birds in the garden as they naturally predate on these caterpillars."
Air Potato,Leaf Spot / Rust (Fungal),"Small brown spots or rusty pustules appear on the leaves. Treatment: This vine is very hardy and semi-wild. Usually requires no treatment, but if severe, remove the infected leaves to keep the vine healthy. Ensure it has a strong tree or trellis to climb into the sunlight."
Air Potato,Fusarium Dry Rot (Fungal Infection),"This appears as brown, dry, and powdery internal rot in stored bulbils. Prevention is your best defense: always ""cure"" your harvest by letting bulbils dry in a shaded, airy spot for several days before long-term storage to toughen the skin. Avoid bruising them during handling. If you find a small infected spot, cut it out and coat the wound with clean wood ash or lime to seal it. Discard completely hollow or light-weight bulbils."
Air Potato,Bacterial Soft Rot (Bacterial Infection),"This causes the edible bulbils to become mushy, wet, and foul-smelling. To treat, you must remove and destroy infected bulbils immediately to stop the ""ooze"" from infecting healthy ones. Keep your storage area cool, dry, and well-ventilated. Avoid washing the bulbils with water before storage; instead, gently brush off the dirt. Sanitize any knife used on infected parts with a bleach solution before touching healthy potatoes."
Air Potato,Yam Nematode Dry Rot (Parasitic Infection),"These microscopic pests cause cracking and dark, flaky rot just beneath the skin of the tuber. Since they persist in the soil and seed, always use certified clean bulbils for planting. If you suspect your soil is infected, practice crop rotation and do not plant yams there for 3 years. For harvest protection, a hot water treatment (soaking tubers in 50°C water for 30 minutes) can kill the nematodes without harming the potato."
Air Potato,Blue Mold Rot (Fungal Infection),"Often seen as a bluish-green fuzzy growth on stored potatoes, this fungus attacks through cuts and scrapes. Handle your harvest gently to prevent skin injuries. Reduce humidity in your storage room to starve the fungus. If infection is surface-level, you can wipe it off with a cloth dipped in vinegar. Check your stored supply weekly and isolate any moldy bulbils instantly to prevent the spores from drifting onto the rest of your stock."
Amaranth,Stem Weevil (Insect Larvae),The stem swells at certain points. The plant growth is stunted and it may break easily. Larvae are tunneling inside. Treatment: This is a major pest for Amaranth. Pull out and destroy infected plants. Harvest the greens early before the population builds up. Clean cultivation (remove weeds) is essential.
Amaranth,White Rust (Fungal),"White blisters appear on the underside of leaves. The upper side shows yellow patches. Treatment: Avoid overhead watering. Harvest frequently to remove the inoculum. If severe, spray a mild copper fungicide, but wait 7-10 days before harvesting greens for food."
Amaranth,White Rust (Fungal Infection),"White, raised blisters appear on the undersides of leaves, while the upper side shows yellow patches. This ruins the leafy green quality. Harvest early if spots appear. Rotate crops; do not plant amaranth in the same spot repeatedly. Spray Mancozeb or Ridomil if not harvesting immediately, but stick to safety periods."
Amaranth,Leaf Blight (Fungal Infection),"Leaves develop brown, water-soaked spots that rot rapidly, especially during rainy seasons (wet rot). Improve drainage and avoid dense planting. Remove infected plants immediately. Spraying with cow urine (diluted 1:10) or Neem oil can act as a preventive bio-fungicide."
Amaranth,Amaranth Stem Weevil (Insect Infestation),"Grubs bore into the succulent edible stems, causing the plant to wither and break. Look for swellings on the stem. Cut open swollen stems to kill larvae. Remove wild amaranth weeds nearby which host the pest. Soil application of Neem cake helps repel the adults from laying eggs."
Amaranth,Leaf Webber (Insect Infestation),Caterpillars roll leaves together and feed inside. Hand squeezing the rolled leaves kills the larvae (if you are not squeamish) or pick them off. Spraying a 5% Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE) is very effective and safe for leafy greens.
Amaranth,Damping Off (Fungal Infection),Affects young seedlings/microgreens; the stem rots at the soil line and the plant topples. Use sterilized potting soil. Do not overwater. Treat seeds with Trichoderma viride before sowing. Ensure plenty of sunlight and air circulation for seedlings.
Amaranth,Aphids (Insect Infestation),Clusters of green/black insects on the stem and leaf undersides suck sap and cause curling. Wash with a strong jet of water. Spray soapy water or Neem oil. Ladybugs are excellent natural controllers for this pest.
Amaranth,Mosaic Virus (Viral Infection),Yellow veins and mottled leaves. The leaves become small and brittle. Pull out infected plants immediately. Control the vectors (aphids/whiteflies). Keep the field weed-free.
Amatekayi,Leaf Beetle (Insect),"A specific beetle (Podontia) eats the leaves, sometimes stripping the tree bare (defoliation). Treatment: Look for large, colorful beetles on the leaves in June-July. Handpick them (they are sluggish in the morning). Dig up the soil around the tree base in summer to kill the pupae hiding there."
Amatekayi,Fruit Fly (Insect Larvae),"Maggots bore into the mature green fruit, causing it to rot from the inside and fall prematurely. Treatment: This is the biggest problem for Amatekayi. Hang ""Methyl Eugenol"" traps on the tree branches when fruits start developing. Collect and bury fallen fruits deep in the ground to break the cycle."
Amatekayi,Anthracnose (Fungal Infection),"Black, sunken spots appear on the fruit skin, which may lead to rotting. Prune the tree to allow light to the inner branches. Spray Copper Oxychloride before flowering and after fruit set. Post-harvest, wash fruits in warm water (50°C) to reduce surface infection."
Amatekayi,Sooty Mold (Fungal Infection),"A black, sticky coating covers the fruit and leaves, growing on honeydew from scale insects. It makes the fruit look dirty. Control the scale insects with Neem oil. Wash the harvested fruit with a mild soap solution to remove the mold before selling or eating."
Amatekayi,Fruit Canker (Bacterial Infection),"Corky, brown, raised lesions appear on the fruit surface. It is difficult to cure. Prune infected twigs during the dry season. Spray Streptocycline (an antibiotic) coupled with copper fungicide during early fruit development."
Amatekayi,Stem End Rot (Fungal Infection),"Rot starts at the stalk end of the harvested fruit and spreads downwards. Avoid pulling fruits; clip them with a stalk attached. Prevent bruising during harvest. Store in a cool, dry place."
Amatekayi,Scale Insects (Insect Infestation),"Small, waxy bumps on the fruit surface suck sap and ruin the appearance. Scrub them off with a soft brush if the infestation is light. Prune heavily infested branches. Apply horticultural oil spray."
Amatekayi,Physiological Fruit Drop (Physiological),Young fruits drop off due to water stress or nutrient lack. Mulch the tree base to retain moisture. Water regularly during fruit setting. Apply a balanced fertilizer with micronutrients.
Amatekayi ,Fruit Fly (Insect Infestation),"Maggots feed inside the ripening fruit, causing it to rot and drop. Set up methyl eugenol pheromone traps to catch male flies. Collect and bury all fallen fruits to break the cycle. Harvest fruits while they are mature but still firm (green) to avoid infestation."
Arrowroot,Leaf Blight (Fungal),"Coastal/Kerala Crop. Large, irregular brown spots with yellow halos appear on the leaves. Leaves dry up, reducing tuber yield. Treatment: Cut off and burn infected leaves. Ensure the soil drains well, as high humidity fuels the fungus. Mulch with dry leaves to prevent soil splash."
Arrowroot,Bacterial Soft Rot (Bacterial Infection),"This causes the rhizomes to turn soft, watery, and mushy with a distinct foul odor. It thrives in wet, poorly drained soils. To manage it, immediately dig up and destroy any infected plants to prevent the bacteria from spreading to the soil. Ensure you plant in raised beds with excellent drainage. After harvest, wash the rhizomes in clean water and let them dry completely in a cool area before storage. discard any tubers with cuts or bruises immediately."
Arrowroot,Pythium Rhizome Rot (Fungal Infection),"This infection creates water-soaked lesions on the rhizomes that eventually turn brown and decay, especially in waterlogged conditions. Prevention is key: never overwater your crop and ensure the soil is loose and sandy. If you detect rot during the growing season, reduce watering immediately and improve airflow. When planting next season, treat your seed rhizomes with a biological fungicide like Trichoderma to protect them from soil-borne spores. Rotate crops and avoid planting in the same spot for 3 years."
Arrowroot,Fusarium Dry Rot (Fungal Infection),"Unlike soft rot, this fungus causes the internal flesh of the arrowroot to become dry, powdery, and brown while the skin wrinkles. It often enters through harvest wounds. To treat, you must ""cure"" your harvest by leaving the rhizomes in a warm, shaded, well-ventilated spot for a few days to heal minor skin injuries. Handle the harvest gently to avoid bruises. If you see white or pink mold developing on stored tubers, remove them instantly to save the rest."
Arrowroot,Banded Leaf and Sheath Blight (Fungal Infection),"While often seen on leaves, this fungus (Rhizoctonia solani) can travel down and rot the rhizome scales, causing brown, scabby lesions. It spreads rapidly in hot, humid weather. To control it, strip away infected lower leaves and keep the base of the plant clear of weeds and debris. Avoid piling soil too high against the stems. If the infection is severe, harvest the mature rhizomes early to prevent the rot from penetrating deeper into the edible flesh."
Arrowroot,Burrowing Nematode Damage (Parasitic Infection),"These microscopic worms burrow into the rhizome, causing dark, necrotic tunnels inside the white flesh, which leads to secondary rotting. Since they live in the soil, your best treatment is hot water disinfection: soak your planting material in 50°C water for 20–30 minutes before planting. Add plenty of organic compost or neem cake to your soil, as this encourages beneficial microbes that naturally suppress nematode populations. Avoid planting arrowroot in soil previously used for bananas or ginger."
Ash Gourd,Melon Fruit Fly (Insect Larvae),"This is the most destructive pest. Adult flies puncture young fruits to lay eggs, and maggots eat the inside, causing the fruit to rot. Treatment: Wrap young fruits in newspaper or cloth bags as soon as they set (finger size) to create a physical barrier. Use ""Methyl Eugenol"" pheromone traps to lure and catch male flies. Collect and bury any fallen, infested fruit deep in the soil to kill the maggots."
Ash Gourd,Fruit Rot (Fungal),"Water-soaked, soft lesions appear on the fruit, usually where it touches damp soil. White cottony fungus may grow on the spot. Treatment: Prevention is the only real cure. Never let the gourd sit on bare soil; place a wooden board, stone, or thick straw mulch under every fruit. Improve soil drainage and avoid watering in the late evening. If infection starts, harvest immediately and cut away the rotting part."
Ash Gourd,Blossom End Rot (Physiological),"Young fruits turn black and shrivel starting from the blossom end (tip), often dropping off. Treatment: This is often due to poor pollination or calcium deficiency. Hand-pollinate female flowers in the morning to ensure fruit set. Keep soil moisture consistent (not soaked) to help the roots absorb calcium. Add lime or crushed eggshells to the soil to boost calcium levels. Remove rotting young fruits immediately."
Ash Gourd,Mosaic Virus (Viral),"While this affects the whole plant, it specifically causes the fruit to become small, deformed, and ""warty"" (bumpy), making it unappealing. Treatment: There is no cure. Remove and burn the infected plant immediately to save the rest. The virus is spread by aphids, so control them using yellow sticky traps or insecticidal soap sprays. Sterilize pruning tools with alcohol after touching an infected plant."
Ash Gourd,Downy Mildew (Fungal),"Yellow spots on top of leaves, grey fuzz below. Leaves dry up. Treatment: Trellis the vines to keep them off damp soil. Prune dense foliage. Spray Pseudomonas fluorescens (bio-agent)."
Ash Gourd,Fruit Fly (Insect Infestation),"Maggots bore into the developing gourd, causing soft rot and premature yellowing. Wrap individual fruits in newspaper or cloth bags when they are small. Use pheromone traps. Destroy all damaged fruits."
Ash Gourd,Powdery Mildew (Fungal Infection),"White powder on leaves and stems reduces plant energy, leading to small, poor-quality fruits. Spray wettable sulfur or Karathane. Remove weed hosts. Ensure vines are well-spaced."
Ash Gourd,Downy Mildew (Fungal Infection),Yellow angular spots on leaves that turn brown; it can affect fruit quality. Spray Mancozeb or Metalaxyl. Avoid overhead watering. Prune lower leaves to increase airflow near the soil.
Ash Gourd,Mosaic Virus (Viral Infection),"Fruits become bumpy, small, and mottled green/yellow. Leaves curl. Remove infected plants immediately. Control aphids and whiteflies. Use virus-resistant varieties if available."
Ash Gourd,Red Pumpkin Beetle (Insect Infestation),Orange beetles eat holes in flowers and young fruit skin. Handpick beetles in the early morning when they are sluggish. Dust wood ash on the plants. Spray Neem oil to repel them.
Ash Gourd,Gummy Stem Blight (Fungal Infection),Causes gummy ooze on stems and black rot on the fruit. Rotate crops (don't plant gourds for 2-3 years). Use treated seeds. Spray Chlorothalonil if symptoms appear.
Ash Gourd,Blossom End Rot (Calcium Deficiency),The bottom end of the fruit turns black and leathery. This is not a germ but a calcium lack often caused by irregular watering. Water consistently. Mulch the soil. Add lime or gypsum to the soil before planting.
Attikka,Fig Fruit Fly (Insect Larvae),"Almost every wild fig is infested with tiny wasps/flies. The fruit looks ripe but is full of insects inside. Treatment: For culinary use (cooking raw figs), harvest them when they are still firm and green (unripe). Cut them open and soak in salted turmeric water for 30 minutes to drive out any insects. Use pheromone traps in the garden."
Attikka,Rust (Fungal),The undersides of leaves are covered in rusty brown dust. Leaves fall off early. Treatment: This usually affects the tree after the rains. Rake up and burn the fallen leaves. Prune the tree to improve airflow. It usually recovers on its own without chemical treatment.
Attikka,Fig Fruit Borer (Insect Infestation),"This is the most common issue where larvae bore into the fruit, making it inedible and filled with frass. Collect and destroy all fallen, infested fruits immediately to break the breeding cycle. You can protect the fruit clusters by bagging them with fine mesh or cloth bags when they are small to physically prevent moths from laying eggs. Applying neem oil spray early in the fruit-setting stage helps repel the adult moths effectively."
Attikka,Anthracnose (Fungal Infection),"Symptoms include dark, sunken, circular spots on the fig skin which can turn pinkish during wet weather. Prune the tree to open up the canopy, allowing sunlight to dry the fruits quickly after rain. Remove and burn any dried, mummified fruits left on the tree from the previous season. If severe, spray a copper-based fungicide or Bordeaux mixture during the early fruit formation stage. Avoid overhead irrigation to keep the fruit surface dry."
Attikka,Fruit Splitting and Sour Rot (Physiological/Fungal),"Sudden heavy watering after a dry spell causes the skin to split, allowing yeast and bacteria to enter and cause sour fermentation. Prevention is entirely about water management; keep the soil moisture consistent by mulching the base of the tree with organic matter. Harvest split fruits immediately if they aren't rotten yet. If they smell sour or attract fruit flies, dispose of them far away to prevent the spread of souring bacteria to healthy figs."
Attikka,Fig Rust (Fungal Infection),"While primarily on leaves, severe rust causes rusty-brown pustules on the fruit skin, making them rough and unappealing. Clean up all fallen leaves and debris around the tree base to remove overwintering spores. Avoid wetting the fruit clusters when watering. Thinning the fruit clusters can help improve airflow around individual figs. If necessary, use a sulfur-based organic fungicide, but ensure it is safe for edible fruits and apply it well before harvest time."
Attikka,Botrytis Limb Blight/Rot (Fungal Infection),"This fungus can attack ripening figs, causing them to turn brown, mushy, and covered in gray mold. It usually strikes during cool, damp weather. Promptly harvest ripe fruit; do not let over-ripe figs hang on the tree. Prune dense branches to increase air circulation, which helps the fruit dry out. If you spot a moldy fig, remove it gently without shaking it to avoid releasing spores onto adjacent healthy fruits."
Avocado,Root Rot (Fungal),"The tree canopy thins out, leaves turn small and pale/yellow, and branches die back (Staghorn look). The feeder roots turn black and brittle. Treatment: This is caused by Phytophthora in wet soil. Avocado hates ""wet feet."" Ensure excellent drainage; plant on mounds if soil is clay-heavy. Apply a trunk paste of Bordeaux mixture. Mulch with heavy organic matter to encourage healthy soil microbes."
Avocado,Anthracnose (Fungal Infection),Brown to black spots on the fruit skin; flesh rots underneath as it ripens. Prune dead limbs. Spray copper fungicides during bloom and fruit set. Handle fruit gently to avoid bruising which activates the fungus.
Avocado,Avocado Scab (Fungal Infection),"Raised, corky, brown-purplish spots on the fruit skin. It is cosmetic but reduces market value. Spray copper fungicide when flower buds appear and again when fruit is small. Prune to improve airflow."
Avocado,Stem End Rot (Fungal Infection),"Rot begins at the stem end as the fruit ripens, turning flesh dark and soft. Harvest fruit with a short stem attached (do not snap off). Keep harvested fruit cool (5-10°C). Avoid harvesting during wet weather."
Avocado,Cercospora Spot (Fungal Infection),"Small, angular brown spots on fruit with a yellow halo. It can crack the skin, allowing other rots in. Control is similar to Anthracnose: copper sprays and good canopy management to reduce humidity."
Avocado,Phytophthora Fruit Rot (Fungal Infection),"Fruit hanging near the ground develops black, firm rot. Mulch under trees to prevent soil splash. Prune low-hanging branches so fruit doesn't touch the ground. Apply a phosphorous acid fungicide."
Avocado,Fruit Fly (Insect Infestation),"Larvae tunnel through the flesh, causing decay. Use protein bait sprays to kill adult flies. Harvest fruit promptly when mature. Pick up and destroy fallen fruit."
Avocado,Sunblotch (Viroid Infection),Causes yellow or red sunken streaks on the fruit; fruit may be distorted. There is no cure. Use only certified disease-free nursery trees. Sterilize pruning tools with bleach between trees.
Baby Corn,"Downy Mildew / ""Crazy Top"" (Fungal)","The plant looks bushy at the top (like a broom) and leaves have yellow/white streaks. It fails to produce cobs. Treatment: Use resistant hybrid seeds. There is no cure for the infected plant; pull it out and burn it. Drain the field well, as waterlogging encourages this fungus."
Baby Corn,Stem Borer (Insect Larvae),"You will see ""shot holes"" (pinholes) in the leaves as they unfurl. The central shoot may die. Treatment: Since Baby Corn is harvested very young (within 50-60 days), chemical sprays are risky. Apply a pinch of ash or sand mixed with lime into the central plant funnel to irritate and drive out the larvae."
Baby Corn,Corn Earworm (Insect Infestation),Larvae feed on the silk and the tip of the young cob. Apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or Spinosad to the silks. Mineral oil applied to the silk channel can suffocate larvae.
Baby Corn,Common Smut (Fungal Infection),"Large, grey, puffball-like galls form on the kernels. Remove galls immediately before they burst and release spores. Avoid mechanical injury to plants. distinct varieties are more resistant."
Baby Corn,Fusarium Stalk/Ear Rot (Fungal Infection),White or pinkish mold on the kernels; kernels may rot. Plant resistant hybrids. Balance nitrogen fertilizers. Harvest baby corn early before the fungus can establish in the ear.
Baby Corn,Turcicum Leaf Blight (Fungal Infection),"Large, boat-shaped grey lesions on leaves reduce photosynthesis, leading to small, poorly filled ears. Spray Mancozeb or Zineb. Rotate crops with non-grass species."
Baby Corn,Rust (Fungal Infection),Brown pustules on husks and leaves make the ear unappealing. Plant resistant varieties. Spray wettable sulfur if infection is early. destroy crop debris after harvest.
Baby Corn,Bacterial Stalk Rot (Bacterial Infection),"The stalk and ear shank turn soft, slimy, and smell of rotting fish. The ear may drop. Avoid waterlogging. Use chlorinated water for irrigation if possible. Bleaching powder drenching (light) can help soil sanitation."
Baby Corn,Aphids (Insect Infestation),Swarms of aphids inside the husk make the baby corn sticky and sooty. Spray Neem oil or soap solution. Encourage ladybugs. Check husks carefully before marketing.
Bamboo Shoots,Bamboo Blight / Rot (Fungal),"The tender emerging shoot turns brown, soft, and rots before it grows tall. This often happens in waterlogged clumps. Treatment: Keep the bamboo clump clean; remove old, dead stems to improve airflow. Ensure water doesn't stagnate around the base. Cover the emerging shoot with a mound of dry soil to protect it from direct moisture and harvest it quickly while tender."
Bamboo Shoots,Shoot Borer (Insect Larvae),"Larvae bore into the soft, young shoot, causing the tip to dry up (""dead heart"") and the shoot to die. Treatment: This is common in the forest areas of Malnad. Clear away fallen leaves around the clump to remove hiding spots. If you see a bore hole, the shoot is likely spoiled; remove it. Light traps during the monsoon season help catch the adult moths."
Bamboo Shoots,Rot of Emerging Culms (Fungal Infection),"This infection attacks young, tender shoots just as they emerge, causing water-soaked brown lesions that eventually turn the whole shoot into a soft, rotting mass smelling of molasses. To save your crop, ensure excellent soil drainage and remove any rotting debris from the clump base before the rainy season. If infection spots appear, drench the soil with a copper-based fungicide or use Trichoderma bio-agents. Harvest healthy shoots early to minimize exposure to wet soil conditions."
Bamboo Shoots,Bamboo Mosaic Virus (Viral Infection),"This virus creates hard, brown, necrotic streaks inside the white flesh of the shoot (often called ""nails""), ruining its texture and market value. Since there is no chemical cure, your primary tool is sterilization. The virus spreads mainly through infected harvesting knives; always dip your tools in a bleach solution or heat them between cuts. Dig up and burn infected clumps to stop the spread. Always source certified virus-free seedlings for new plantations."
Bamboo Shoots,Bacterial Soft Rot (Bacterial Infection),"This causes the harvested shoots to become mushy, slimy, and foul-smelling, especially at the cut end. It enters through harvest wounds. Prevent this by harvesting carefully to avoid splitting the base. Keep harvested shoots dry and cool; never wash them in dirty water. If you must store them, trim the cut end cleanly and coat it with a lime paste or food-grade wax to seal out bacteria. Process or cook the shoots immediately after harvest if possible."
Bamboo Shoots,Bamboo Shoot Borer (Insect Infestation),"Larvae bore deep into the tender shoot, creating tunnels filled with excrement and causing the shoot to rot from the inside. Watch for small entry holes or wilting tips on young shoots. Remove and destroy infested shoots immediately to kill the larvae before they mature. Light traps can catch adult moths at night. For organic control, apply neem oil to the soil and base of the clump during the emergence season to repel the pests from laying eggs."
Bamboo Shoots,Basal Rot (Fungal Infection),"This fungus attacks the connection point between the rhizome and the shoot, causing the shoot to discolor and die before it fully emerges. It is often linked to waterlogging. Improve aeration by thinning out old, crowded culms from the center of the clump. Apply a soil drench of Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate and lime) around the clump base. Avoid piling wet soil or compost directly against the emerging shoots during the wettest months."
Banana,Sigatoka Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Very Common. Small yellow spots on leaves turn into brown streaks. Leaves die early, leaving the bunch without food. Treatment: Cut off infected leaves and leave them on the ground (face down). Ensure good drainage. A spray of mineral oil or neem-based fungicides helps protect remaining green leaves."
Banana,Rhizome Rot (Bacterial/Fungal),The plant topples over easily. The underground rhizome is soft and rotting with a foul smell. Treatment: Use healthy suckers. Dip suckers in copper oxychloride solution before planting. Ensure excellent drainage.
Banana,Panama Wilt (Fungal),"The lower leaves turn bright yellow and hang down around the stem like a skirt. The plant eventually dies. Treatment: This fungus lives in the soil for years. There is no cure for the infected plant; dig it out and burn it. Do not replant banana in that spot. Use resistant varieties (like ""Nendran"" or ""Poovan"")."
Banana,Cigar End Rot (Fungal Infection),The tip of the fruit dries out and looks like the ash of a cigar. Remove the flower remnants (pistils) from the finger tips in the field as soon as fruit forms. Bag the bunches.
Banana,Crown Rot (Fungal Infection),"The cut surface of the ""hand"" (where it joins the stalk) turns black and rots, causing fingers to drop. Clean cutting knives. Treat the cut crown with alum or fungicide paste immediately after de-handing."
Banana,Banana Weevil (Insect Infestation),"Grubs bore into the corm and stem, but can also attack fruit stalks, leading to small bunches. Use clean planting material (corms). Trapping with cut stem pieces works well. Apply Neem cake to soil."
Banana,Banana Bunchy Top (Viral Infection),Plants are stunted; bunches are small and deformed. Leaves bunch at the top. Dig up and destroy infected mats immediately. Control aphids which spread the virus. Use virus-free tissue culture plants.
Banana,Fruit Scarring Beetle (Insect Infestation),"Beetles feed on the skin of young fruit, leaving rough, scabby scars that ruin market value. Bag the bunch with plastic or cloth covers immediately after the hands open. Keep the plantation weed-free."
Banana,Freckle Disease (Fungal Infection),Sandpaper-like raised black spots on the fruit peel and leaves. Bagging bunches helps. Prune infected leaves. Spray Mancozeb or mineral oil during fruit development.
Banana ,Anthracnose (Fungal Infection),"Dark, sunken spots on the ripe fruit peel; the flesh inside may rot. Wash fruit after harvest to remove latex. Dip in hot water (50°C for 5 mins) or fungicide before storage. Avoid bruising."
Banana Flower,Banana Bunchy Top (Viral),"New leaves are narrow, upright, and bunched together at the top (like a brush). The plant stops growing and won't produce the flower/fruit. Treatment: This is a serious virus spread by aphids. There is no cure. Inject the infected plant with herbicide or dig it out completely and burn it. Do not plant new suckers near infected areas. Control aphids to prevent spread."
Banana Flower,Sigatoka Leaf Spot (Fungal),"Small yellow spots on leaves turn into brown streaks. Leaves die early, leaving the bunch (and flower) without food. Treatment: Cut off the infected leaves and leave them on the ground (face down). Ensure good drainage in the plantation. A spray of mineral oil or neem-based fungicides helps protect the remaining green leaves."
Banana Flower,Bacterial Soft Rot (Bacterial Infection),"This infection turns the flower tip and bracts soft, mushy, and foul-smelling, often spreading from the fruit tip upwards. It thrives in hot, wet weather. To stop it, cut off the infected flower bell immediately using a sterilized knife to save the rest of the bunch. disposing of the rotting material far from the plant is crucial. Ensure good airflow around the bunch by removing excess leaves. disinfect tools with bleach between cuts to prevent spreading the bacteria."
Banana Flower,Anthracnose (Fungal Infection),"You will see black, sunken, or necrotic spots on the outer purple bracts of the flower, which can penetrate the inner florets. To manage this, remove and discard the damaged outer layers before bringing them into the kitchen. On the plant, ensure the flower does not rub against leaves or stems, as injuries invite fungus. In severe cases, bag the developing bunch with a perforated plastic sleeve to keep it dry and protected from spores and pests."
Banana Flower,Flower Thrips Damage (Insect Infestation),"Thrips are tiny insects that hide inside the tight bracts, causing rusty, brown, and corky streaks on the flower petals and florets. While often cosmetic on the outer layers, heavy infestation can ruin the texture. Prevention involves bagging the flower early in its development. For harvested flowers, soak the blossom in salt water or turmeric water for 20 minutes before cooking; this drives the insects out and cleans the florets effectively. Neem oil spray on the plant also helps."
Banana Flower,Cigar End Rot (Fungal Infection),"This fungus causes the tip of the flower (and emerging fingers) to dry out, turn grey/black, and look like burnt ash or a cigar tip. It enters through the dying florets. To treat, manually remove the pistils and withered floral parts as soon as the hands form. If the flower bell itself is infected, harvest it immediately. Improve field sanitation by removing trash from around the mat, as the fungus survives in decaying plant debris."
Banana Flower,Banana Aphid Infestation (Insect Infestation),"Aphids cluster under the bracts, sucking sap and leaving sticky honeydew that attracts black sooty mold, making the flower unappealing. They also transmit the Bunchy Top Virus. Control them by spraying a strong jet of water or insecticidal soap directly into the bract crevices. If harvesting for food, discard the outer layers and wash the inner heart thoroughly in vinegar water. Introducing beneficial insects like lady beetles into your garden can naturally keep the aphid population down."
Beans,Bacterial Blight (Bacterial),"The pods develop small water-soaked spots that turn brown and sunken, rendering them inedible. Treatment: Use seeds from healthy plants only. Remove infected plants immediately to prevent spreading bacteria. Avoid overhead sprinklers; always water at the base to keep pods dry. A preventative spray of a copper-based fungicide can help protect the remaining healthy pods if the weather is humid."
Beans,Pod Borer (Insect Larvae),Caterpillars bore holes into the green pods and eat the developing seeds inside. Treatment: Handpick and destroy any visible caterpillars. Remove any pods with holes instantly. Use pheromone traps to catch adult moths. Spraying a 5% Neem Seed Kernel Extract (NSKE) when flowering starts helps deter the moths from laying eggs on the young pods.
Beans,Anthracnose (Fungal),"Dark, sunken, circular spots with reddish borders appear directly on the pods. Treatment: Never touch or harvest beans when plants are wet, as water spreads the fungus. Rotate crops annually. Remove infected pods immediately. Spraying a mixture of baking soda and water (1 tsp per liter) or a bio-fungicide like Trichoderma can protect new young pods from developing these spots."
Beans,Powdery Mildew (Fungal),"While usually on leaves, in severe cases, the white powdery growth covers the pods, causing them to malform and dry out. Treatment: Spray a mixture of milk and water (1:9 ratio) in bright sunlight; it acts as a natural fungicide. Dusting the plants with sulphur powder is very effective. Prune dense foliage to ensure sunlight reaches the pods."
Beans,Rust (Fungal),"Rust-colored pustules appear on the pods, making them unsightly and weak. Prune plants to ensure sunlight reaches the interior. Clear away fallen debris where spores hide. Avoid wetting the foliage when watering. Dusting plants with sulphur powder or spraying a wettable sulphur solution is a common organic treatment. Early detection and removal of affected parts can save the rest of the crop."
